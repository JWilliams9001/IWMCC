            CHAMPIONSHIP CHALLENGER . . .
            Dublin rider Ian Williams (Ariel ) who rides in to-morrow’s Hurst Cup International Trial at Conling,
            Belfast.
            
            
            
            Hurst Cup Trial Has<br> Big English Entry
            
            By BASIL
            BRINDLEY
            
            
            WITH an entry of 79 for to-morrow’s Hurst Cup Trial,<br> officials of the Knock Motor Cycle Club must be<br> feeling very happy, as 80 is the
            maximum figure<br> specified on the regulations.
            
            
            
            The international event<br> will be held over a number of<br> laps
            in the Clandeboye<br> Estate, Belfast, and total<br>
            distance will be somewhat<br> less than 50 miles.
            English competitors did excep-<br> tionally well last year and,<br> judging by
            the increase in their<br> numbers on this occasion, they<br> intend to return
            with the valuable<br> perpetual trophy for another 12<br> months.
            The Sunbeam Motor Cycle Club<br> is
            responsible for no less than<br> seven members of the eighteen-<br> strong cross
            -Channel challenge.<br> Included in this team are Johnny<br>
            Brittain (Royal Enfield),
            P. H.<br> Alves (Triumph), B. W. Martin<br> ( B.S.A.) and the Wicken
            brothers<br> who will be Norman and
            Triumph-<br> mounted.
            Scotsman J. H. Birrell has entered<br> a junior "Gold Star" while other<br> visitors of note
            are E. Usher (Match-<br>
            less), G. L. Jackson (A.J.S.), E. W.<br> Smith
            (Francis Barnett) and J.
            V.<br> Smith (B.S.A.)<br> Leinster will be represented by<br> practically every
            outstanding rider in<br> the province and regulars like Dudley<br>
            Ryder (Matchless),
            Joe Dawson<br> (
            B.S.A.), Mick Tracey (Norton),<br>
            Freddie Dickson (Sun) and Kevin<br> Keegan (B.S.A.) may be relied upon<br> to acquit
            themselves well.
            
            
            
            
             Strong Ulster Bid
            Travelling up from the south also<br> with good reputations are
            Dave<br> Felton ( Francis
            Barnett), Ian<br> Williams,
            Reg Armstrong (Gilera)<br>
            and James exponents
            Ernie Lyons,<br>
            Doug Ewen and Aubrey Archer.
            With over 50 p.c. of the entry,<br>
            Ulster is in a strong position and<br> if a Six-County man
             is to win the<br> event,
            it’s odds on Sammy Miller<br> from
            Belfast being the one to do<br> it. Riding a
            197 c.c, James, this<br> road
            racing and trials star has<br> proved himself almost invincible<br> during the
            season and he must<br> have an outstanding chance to-<br> morrow.
            
            Able support will come from Bill<br> Clark (Royal Enfield). Tommy
            Robb<br> ( Francis
            Barnett), W. J. Hutton<br> (Greeves), Terry Hill
            (B.S.A.), Brian<br>
            McClery (Royal Enfield)
            and Bertie<br> Mann (Francis
            Barnett), all of whom<br> have been figuring well in this
            year’s<br> events.
            The trial begins at 12 o’clock and<br> starting point is near the Lead
            Mines,<br> Conling.

            Dublin and District Motor Cycle<br> Club's Moto-Cross
            last Saturday<br> indicated that there is a bright<br> future in this country
            for such<br> an event
            
            Irish riders’ lack of practice was<br> obvious and if they are to hold<br> their
            own in the future there must<br> be more events for training. It was<br> very
            interesting to see how quickly<br> some of them "caught on” last Satur-<br> day.
            The outstanding Irish competi-<br> tor was Ian
            Williams, who has had<br> some experience recently in
            Eng-<br> land, where he was riding for the<br> Ariel
            factory.
            
            
            The most obvious things that<br> our men have to
            learn are. keep-<br> ing the taps open and front wheel<br> control. It was
            wonderful to see<br> how the British experts could con-<br> trol their bikes
            at higher speeds<br> than those at which many of our<br> men were losing
            control of their<br> machines.
            
            Front wheel lifting seems to be<br> the answer. At one particularly<br> tricky
            point, the course crossed a<br> lane. Here the less experienced were<br> “
            jumping ” their machines at the<br> start of the crossing, landing on the<br>
            far side of the lane and “ jumping ”<br> a second time
            
            
            
            
            MUCH QUICKER
            
            
            THE experts took it much faster,<br> cleared the
            lot with one jump<br> and landed on the back wheel,<br> keeping the front wheel
            off the<br> ground until they had things<br> perfectly under control.
            
            Alex Woods was another of<br> Irish competitors who showed
            up<br> well earning fourth place in the<br> 350 race and fifth, after Williams,<br> in the 500 race on his fast 350<br>
            machine. Ernie Lyons did well to<br> drive a “wedge” amongst
            the four<br>
            Dot works men in the 250 race but<br>
            it appeared to me that his N.S.U.<br>
            did not have the speed of the Dots,<br> and he appeared to tire,
            possibly through having to work so hard<br> with a
            slower machine.
            
             The surprise of the meeting was<br> the great improvement in the riding<br> of
            Eric Williams, brother of Ian.<br> His win in the handicap was well<br> merited.
             Revenue is a big difficulty for<br> clubs here as the big events are<br> road
            races where no admission<br> charge is possible, but I think that<br> more
            events of the Moto-Cross<br> variety, which are run on enclosed<br> circuits
            where a charge can be col-<br> lected, may at least be part of the<br>
            answer.
            
            
            
            
            BIG ATTENDANCE
            
            THIS type of sport is a novelty
            to<br> Irish people, but there was<br> quite a big attendance on
            Satur-<br> day, and as word gets around as<br> to its
            value its appeal will<br> increase.
            
            I know that the calendar is<br> already very full, but it might be<br> worth
            while dropping some other<br> events in favour of the Moto-Cross,<br> and now is
            the time to plan.
            
            With the last of the racing season<br> events on Saturday, the
            5OO<br>
            M.R.C.I. car meeting in
            Ulster, the<br> trials season opens in a big
            way<br> this month.
            
            For bikes there are three champion-<br> ship trials in October, the
            Belfast and<br>
            District Club’s, Barr Trophy
            (6th),<br> the Dublin and District Club’s,<br>
            Moran Cup (13th), and the Ulster<br>
            President’s Cup (27th).
            
            On Saturday in the Dublin area<br> there is the Dublin University Club’s,<br>
            Fall Trial, starting from Lamb<br> Doyles (3.0). For cars on Saturday<br> there is the Leinster Club’s, Vigzol<br> Cup
            Trial, a non-observed event,<br> starting from the Phoenix Monument<br> (3.0).
            
            On Sunday there is the first of the<br> trials counting towards this season’s<br>
            Hewison Trophy competition, the<br>
            Limerick Club’s
            Circuit of Clare,<br> which this year takes the place
            in<br> the series of the same club’s Circuit<br> of
            Munster. The other Hewison event<br> this month
            is the Kilkenny Winter<br> Trial
            (28th). 
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            Dublin And District Motor<br> Cycle Club Had Day Out
            
            CONGRATULATIONS to the
            Dublin and District Motor Cycle <br> Club whose International Moto Cross meeting on Saturday <br> last was one of the
            most entertaining fixtures of the season. <br> the course at
            Redbog was ideally suited for this sport and many <br>
            of the English works ridersdescribed it as one of the
            <br> best in  Europe. <br>
            
            
            
            
            
            In the light og such an enthusi-<br>astic reception it is now very much <br>
            more than a possibility that next<br> year's meeting will be included on <br>
            the world championship table with <br> the result that
            we may have a <br> unique invasion of manufacturers <br> teams including leading
            English<br> and Continental exponents.<br>
            As expected the B.S.A and the Dot<br> nominees
            made a clean sweep in<br> the last three scratch races
            on Satur-<br> day last but quite a few names were made by Irishmen whose
            pre-<br> vious experience was gained from <br> dabbling in other branches of
            the<br> game together with a mere handful <br> of scrambles.<br>
            Perhaps the most impressive was <br>
            Harry O'Reilly's son, Frank, who<br>
            rode his Lightweight Tandon with <br>
            an unbounded exuberance which <br> made quite a few of the stars, and <br> in
            particular Bill Barugh og the <br>
            Dot team, sit up and take note <br> After figuring
            prominently in the <br> qualifying heat Frank put every-
            <br> thing he knew into the final and <br> going into the lead on the third lap
            <br> he stayed in front until the last half mile where he was headed by <br>
            Eric Williams on the Mountjoy<br> entered Ariel.<br>
            
            
            
             FIGURED PROMINENTLY
             If he continues to improve at <br> the present rate there is little
            <br> doubt that Frank O'Reilly could <br> turn out to be a
            really top class <br> Moto Cross and Road Racing star <br> He has certainly put
            his Grasstrack <br> experience to great use and his long distance road racing
            debut on the Brian Somers B.S.A at this<br> year's
            Skerries "100" gave some indication of the Dubliner's
            ability
            The Williams brothers, Ian and <br>
            Eric also caught the eye on Saturday <br> last and
            both of them figured promi-<br> nently in the awards list. Indeed <br> were it
            not for the fact that Eric<br> had shown such a
            terrific improve-<br>ment in his riding he could never <br> have overhauled
            Frank O'Reilly in<br> order to capture the Freeman  Trophy in the general handicap final.
            Ian, who rode at several cross
            <br> Channel meetings last season was <br> the fastest Irishman of the
            dat as <br> he took Ted Barret's other Ariel into <br> fourth place in the Senior scratch <br> race despite a heavy tumbe en
            route<br> He also occupied a similar position <br> in the general handicap and
            con <br> sidering that he was riding off such <br> a short mark of one and a
            half <br> minutes he did extremely well to get the flag so near to
            Brian Stone- <br>bridge the B.S.A expert.<br>
            
            The evergreen Ernie Lyons gave <br> the huge crowds plenty
            to enthuse <br> over in the 250 c.c. event and his <br>
            fourth position behind three of the <br> Dot men and in
            front of another <br> of them calls for honourable men-<br>tion Unfortunately
            Freddie Dixon<br> who was also expected to do well in
            <br> the same event broke his frame on<br> the first lap and took no further
            <br> part in the proceedings
            
            
            NORTHERN SUCCESSES
            Several Ulster riders hit the <br> headlines during the
            afternoon.<br> the most successful of them being <br>
            Alex McFarland Woods from Bel-
            <br>fast who finished fourth to the B.S.A. team in the 350
            c.c. scratch<br> race fifth to Ian
            Williams and the <br> same trio in the Senior
            event and <br> sixth in the genereal handicap all on a Junior 'Gold Star".
            Alan Bradshaw made news with his <br>
            Francis-Barnett when taking a very
            <br> creditable sixth in the opening en-<br> counter and he finished up the day
            <br> as eight man home in the general <br> handicap with a comparatively <br>
            short allowance of one lap.
            The Car Trials season gets into its <br> stride this
            weekend when the Lein-<br> ster Motor Club holds it Vigzol Cup <br> meeting over a 60 mile course start-<br>
            ing in the Phoenix Park at 3 p.m<br> on
            Saturday. Navigation by Ordnance <br> Survey sheets No. 16 and 13 will play <br>
            an important part in prodeedings <br> and references by the old and new <br>
            grid system will be supplied to com<br>petitors

            <br>
            Hewison Trophy competition
             and<br> because of this all leading
            Dublin<br> and Provincial enthusiasts are ex-<br>pected to make the
            journey for this<br> well supported fixture.

            and Ernie Lyons again <br> had some close tussles,
            Lyons winning the <br>
            graded scratch race and Williams the 500 <br>c.c. scratch in the

            B.S.A. Works Team For<br> D. And D. Meeting
            
            
            
            B.S.A.’s have just announced
            their<br> intention of sending over an<br> official works team for the Dublin<br> and District Motor Cycle
            Club’s<br> International Moto Cross meeting<br> over the new course at
            Red Bog<br> later in the month and this news<br> will
            certainly give a terrific boost<br> to the already highly interesting<br>
            programme.<br>
            The Birmingham factory will be<br> represented by the high
            ranking<br> English stars, Brian Stonebridge,<br>
            David Tye and Terry Cheshire all<br> of
            whom will be supplied with<br>
            Senior and Junior " Gold Stars.”<br>
            Cheshire and Tye were both seen<br> in
            action at the Curragh last year,<br> but
            Stonebridge, who is in the<br> world championship class
            will be<br> making his first appearance on our<br> soil.<br>
            Enquiries have also been received<br> from Dutch and German riders and<br> it is
            quite possible that a number<br> of them will make the trip to<br>
            Ireland immediately after the con-<br> clusion of the
            International Six<br> Days’ Trial on  the
            Continent.<br> Well-known Ulster men already<br> included in the
            colourful line-up are<br>
            Alex McFarland-Woods, Brian Cross<br>
            and Alan Bradshaw while the cross-<br> Channel Dot team have asked for<br> special permission to compete in
            all<br> classes. Fortunately there is a<br> clause in the regulations which<br>
            makes a proviso giving visitors a<br> special concession in this respect so<br>
            that Bill Barugh and his team<br> mates will be able to face
            the<br> starter as often as they wish. 
            And indeed, judging by some of<br> their outstanding performances
            in the past, it is safe to say that<br> these 197 c.c. two-strokers will be<br> more than a match for many
            of<br> their heavyweight rivals.
            One of the strongest Irish teams<br> should be the Ariel
            trio, nominated<br> by Mr. Ted Barrett, of Mountjoy<br> Motor Cycles, Ltd. This very
            fast<br> line-up consists of Des. Cullen and<br> the
            Williams’ brothers, Ian and Eric,<br> who
            have been riding with such dis-<br> tinction during the past few seasons.<br>
            The Phibsboro’ sponsor has always<br> been very closely
            connected with the<br> sport, and any successes gained by<br> his B.S.A. or Ariel nominees have<br> been very well received by
            followers<br> of all branches of the game.
             Most of the leading Dublin expo-<br> nents have already
            sent in their<br> entries, but it should be noted that<br> the list will finally
            close on Satur-<br> day, and no late entries can possibly<br> be considered
            after that date. In-<br> deed. by the looks of things, it may<br> well happen
            that some prospective<br> competitors will have to be included<br> amongst the
            reserves if nominations<br> continue to pour in at the present.

            The best Last.
            For some reason, as yet un-<br> explained, the graded scratch<br> raceswhich normally open the pro-<br>gramme, where
            the last events to be <br> contested at Sunday's open
            grass<br> track, organised by the Dalcassian <br>
            M.C.C., and run over an entirely <br> new course at
            Clonmoney, bun-<br>ratty. And,
            whereas the official pro-<br>gramme proclaimed that four of <br> these events
            should be run, in fact, there were only two. 
            It was the second and fastest of these that the finest
            <br> racing of the season so far was <br>witnessed. For nearly three laps,
            Willie Harris, that most likeable <br> lanky
            County Dublin farmer – whose <br> extreme shyness in
            company con-<br>trasts strangely with his tigerish <br> determination in the
            saddle – held <br> an incredible lead over Mervyn <br>
            Hayes and Ian Williams. The <br>
            magnitudeof Harris's achievement <br> will be
            obvious when it is realised <br> that both Williams and Hayes
            <br> straddled highly specialised J.A.P.
            <br> engined grasstrack specials of 500 <br> c.c., while
            Harris was mounted on a <br> virtually standard–though
            admit-<br>dely dope-burning – Gold Star
            B.S.A. of only 350 c.c. 
            Eventually, both J.A.P.'s got past the
            B.S.A. and spectator interest <br>
            shifted from incredulous admira-<br>tion of
            Harris's
            David versus <br>
            Goliath act, to palpitations
            appre-<br>hension regarding the outcome of<br> the fierce struggle between
            Wil-<br>liams and Hayes.
            For two laps <br>
            Williams, unused to defeat in any <br> class,
            strove mightily to get past <br> his opponent, who enjoyed the ad-<br>vantage of
            an early lead. But <br>
            Hayes, one of the jolliest of men, <br> grinning impishly
            all the time, was <br> as willing to ride on the verge of <br> disaster as the
            other, and won <br> narrowly. The gallant Harris was
            third.... This was a great race! * * *
            
            
            
            
            The Other Events.
            Only less exciting by comparison <br> with such heart-stopping stuff <br> were
            the other events on the pro-<br>gramme. Ian
            Williams had dam-<br>aged the rear suspension of his <br>
            fleet Barnett in practice, and was a
            <br> non-starter in the 250 class, as <br> were the Freddie
            Dickson-Geary<br>
            Scarlet Dot equippe, who failed to
            <br> turn up, so the reliable Jimmy <br> Kavanagh had a
            little troulbe in <br> bringing his Francis Barnett (the <br> only one in the country besides <br>
            William's) into first place.<br> He was followed
            hime by Michael <br> Smurfit on the screaming Dodder
            <br> (a twin-cylinder Akder engine in a <br> Dot frame). Third place went to <br>
            Limerick's Don Kelly on the ex-<br>
            Harrington
            James. There wasn't<br> much real
            opposition in this class <br> – Tommy Griffin's Excelsior was <br> windbroken. Corkman
            Pat O'Shea's Jawa-engined
            special was temper-<br> amental. and, despite neat
            riding, <br>
            Joe MacMahon could do little on <br> an underpowered
            James. <br>
            * * *
            
            
            
            
            * * * <br> Spills and Other Things
            Ian Williams beat Mervyn
            Hayes<br> in the 500 c.c. scratch race.
            Eric <br> Williams, on another J.A.P, was a <br> comfortable second until he spilled.<br>
            George Harris was a good third. <br> Two lads from Cork Club found <br> their way into the
            Munster riders' <br> handicap, and took first and
            second <br> places, after Don Kelly, who was leading by a
            street, spilled through <br> over-eagerness. Actually the
            Naas
            <br> men should not have been allowed<br> to ride in this event, which was<br>
            originally intended for residents in<br> the province of
            Munster only. That <br> remark is not intended to
            belittle <br> the achievement of Con Hederman,<br> who also
            took first place in the <br> all-comer's handicap, in which event<br>
            Dermot
            Byrne of Dublin, out for the
             first time since sustaining a thumb <br> injury at the last
            Dalcassian meet-<br> ing in
            Nenagh, took second place, <br> as well as winning his
            heat. <br>
            * * *
            
            Byrne, in fact, had a real field <br> day, because he also
            took first <br> place in graded scratch race A, <br>
            and Limerick's Dan Kelly had the<br>
            distinction of running into more<br> places than any other rider. Of <br> the
            remaining Limerickmen, Mick<br> MacEoin was foolish enough
            to <br> meddle in a major way with his <br> peak-conquering James on the day<br> before the event, in quest
            of more <br> speed, with the result that the un-<br> fortunate engine gave up
            the ghost<br> of Sunday during the first practice <br> lap. Matt
            Murphy did his best with <br> the same detuned James as Joe <br> McMahon.
            
            The Automobile Association sign-<br>posing was, if
            anything, better<br> than ever, and the Red Cross and <br>
            Garda Siochana played their ex-<br> pected reliable parts
            Without <br> these and other voluntary helpers, <br> including the timekeepers,
            Mr. and <br> Mrs. and the Misses O'Reilly, it <br> would be
            impossible to run a de-<br>cent grasstrack. May their gener-<br> osity be rewarded!<br>

            HEAVY rain made
            the going <br>
            difficult in yesterday's
            Dublin<br>
            District Motor Cycle
            Club's <br>
            
            les at Red Bog, near <br>
            Blessington. and the distance
            of <br> the races was shortened. 
            
            Even then there were very few<br> finishers: in the main event
            <br> only eight finished out of 23 <br> starters.
            
            One of the two Belfast visitors, <br>
            Brian Cross (B.S.A.), won the<br>
            second graded scratch race, the <br> third going to
            Ian Williams<br> (Francis-Barnett), who made best <br> lap of the day in 3 m. 56
            s. In the <br>
            open handicap he made a fast <br> start aand then
            retired. 
            Bob Thompson (Triumph), who <br> had won the first scratch
            race, <br> led the handicap from a long mark <br> for eight of the ten
            laps and then <br> ran into trouble. Brian Lamb. the <br>
            only surviving backmarker, came <br> right through the field and took <br> the
            lead on lap nine to win by <br> nearly two minutes. Results:–

             This is the first time that<br> such an honour has fallen<br> to a provincial
            club.
            And it is due to the fact<br> that the 
            I.M.C.C
            Irish Motorcycle Club
            . date<br> scheduled for yesterday was<br> abandoned because
            the usual<br> course at Hazelhatch was<br> not
            available.

            DOT TWINS
            Some idea of the fare to<br> be expected can be had from<br> the performances in
            last<br> week’s Dunlop scramble.
            Chief interest is in the<br>
            250 c.c. class, where the<br> newly
            imported Dot twins in the hands of Jack
            Kavenagh<br> and Gerald Scarlett do
            battle<br> with the new 
            A.M.C.

            Francis Barnetts, ridden by<br>
            Ian Williams and  Jim<br>
            Kavenagh.
            Ian Williams is Ariel-<br> mounted in the 500 c.c. class.
            The competition comes<br> from his brother, Eric, who<br>
            rides either an Ariel or a<br>
            JAP-engined special, and<br>
            George Harps, also Ariel-<br> mounted.
            Dermot Byrne rides his<br> recently acquired JAP.

            over the Whit<br> week-end.
            This year’s event takes the<br> same form as that of pre-<br> vious years—about
            600 miles<br> of driving in two days.
            here are four starting<br> points — Cork,

            Isle of Man Win<br> For Miller?
            
            
            THIS week sees the annual
            mecca of motor-<br> cyclists in full swing. The Isle of
            Man<br>
            
            TT
            Tourist Trophy
             week is just as attractive as ever and Irish-<br> men are
            likely to be as prominent as usual.
            
            
            
            We stand a good chance<br> of seeing Sammy Miller<br>
            finish in front this year.<br> He will be riding a 125 c.c<br> Ducati in the ultra light-<br>
            weight event over Clypse<br> on Wednesday.
            In the 250 c.c. event he<br> rides a
            Czechoslovakian CZ<br> and his
            competition will<br> include two other Ulster<br> riders who should not be
            too<br> far behind—Tommy Robb<br> and Davy
            Andrews, who<br> ride N.S.U.s entered by<br>
            Tommy Hill.
            
            
            
            FAVOURITE
             Another Ulsterman rides<br> in both senior and junior<br> events on an A.J.S.
            (350)<br> and a Norton (500).
            Judging by practice times<br> last week, it seems that John<br>
            must be a favourite for the senior honours of the<br>
            week on a works M.V.<br> Augusta.
            Irish fans, returning from<br> the Island immediately
            after<br> the 
            I.O.M.
            Isle of Man
             racing, will<br> move straight to
            Butlin’s<br> Holiday Camp, Mosney,<br> where the Dublin and Dis-<br> trict 
            M.C.C.
            Motorcycle Club
            
             hold their<br> annual championship meet-<br> ing next Saturday.
            
            
            
            BIG SURPRISE
            Included in the programme<br> will be the National two-<br>
            mile 500 c.c. and 250 c.c.<br> championships, as well as<br> the 350 c.c. southern centre<br> one.
             I expect Davy Dixon to<br> retain this title, but if a<br>
            southerner comes out on top<br> in either of the others it will<br> be a big
            surprise.
