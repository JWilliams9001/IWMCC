          <p> CHAMPIONSHIP CHALLENGER . . . Dublin rider Ian Williams (Ariel) who rides in
            to-morrow’s Hurst Cup International Trial at Conling, Belfast. </p>
          <h2>Hurst Cup Trial Has Big English Entry</h2>
          <h3>By BASIL BRINDLEY</h3>
          <p> WITH an entry of 79 for to-morrow’s Hurst Cup Trial, officials of the Knock Motor
            Cycle Club must be feeling very happy, as 80 is the maximum figure specified on the
            regulations. </p>
          <p> The international event will be held over a number of laps in the Clandeboye Estate,
            Belfast, and total distance will be somewhat less than 50 miles. </p>
          <p>English competitors did exceptionally well last year and, judging by the increase in
            their numbers on this occasion, they intend to return with the valuable perpetual
            trophy for another 12 months.</p>
          <p>The Sunbeam Motor Cycle Club is responsible for no less than seven members of the
            eighteen- strong cross - Channel challenge. Included in this team are Johnny Brittain
            (Royal Enfield), P. H. Alves (Triumph), B. W. Martin (B.S.A.) and the Wicken brothers
            who will be Norman and Triumph- mounted.</p>
          <p> Scotsman J. H. Birrell has entered a junior " Gold Star" while other visitors of
            note are E. Usher (Match- less), G. L. Jackson (A.J.S.), E. W. Smith (Francis Barnett)
            and J. V. Smith (B.S.A.) </p>

          </p> Leinster will be represented by practically every
          outstanding rider in the province and regulars like Dudley Ryder (Matchless), Joe Dawson
          (B.S.A.), Mick Tracey (Norton), Freddie Dickson (Sun) and Kevin Keegan (B.S.A.) may be
          relied upon to acquit themselves well.
          and J. V. Smith (B.S.A.) </p>


          <h4>Strong Ulster Bid</h4>
          <p> Travelling up from the south also with good reputations are Dave Felton (Francis
            Barnett), Ian Williams, Reg Armstrong (Gilera) and James exponents Ernie Lyons, Doug
            Ewen and Aubrey Archer. </p>
          <p> WITH an entry of 79 for to-morrow’s Hurst Cup Trial, officials of the Knock Motor
            Cycle Club must be feeling very happy, as 80 is the maximum figure specified on the
            regulations. </p>
          <p> With over 50 p.c. Of the entry, Ulster is in a strong position and if a Six-County
            man is to win the event, it’s odds on Sammy Miller from Belfast being the one to do
            it. Riding a 197 c.c, James, this road racing and trials star has proved himself
            almost invincible during the season and he must have an outstanding chance to- morrow. </p>
          <p> Able support will come from Bill Clark (Royal Enfield). Tommy Robb (Francis
            Barnett), W. J. Hutton (Greeves), Terry Hill (B.S.A.), Brian McClery (Royal Enfield)
            and Bertie Mann (Francis Barnett), all of whom have been figuring well in this year’s
            events. </p>
          <p> The trial begins at 12 o’clock and starting point is near the Lead Mines, Conling. </p>

          <h3>12 Irish Independent, Wednesday, October 3, 1956</h3>
          <h5> Motor Sport Review</h5>

          <h2>
            Moto-Cross Was
            Great Success
          </h2>

          <h3> BY BARRY MASON</h3>

          <p>
            THE outstanding success of the
            Dublin and District Motor Cycle
            Club's Moto-Cross last Saturday
            indicated that there is a bright
            future in this country for such
            an event
          </p>
          <p>
            Irish riders’ lack of practice was
            obvious and if they are to hold
            their own in the future there must
            be more events for training. It was
            very interesting to see how quickly
            some of them "caught on” last Satur-
            day. The outstanding Irish competi-
            tor was Ian Williams, who has had
            some experience recently in Eng-
            land, where he was riding for the
            Ariel factory.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most obvious things that
            our men have to learn are. keep-
            ing the taps open and front wheel
            control. It was wonderful to see
            how the British experts could con-
            trol their bikes at higher speeds
            than those at which many of our
            men were losing control of their
            machines.
          </p>
          <p>
            Front wheel lifting seems to be
            the answer. At one particularly
            tricky point, the course crossed a
            lane. Here the less experienced were
            “ jumping ” their machines at the
            start of the crossing, landing on the
            far side of the lane and “ jumping ”
            a second time
          </p>

          <h4>MUCH QUICKER</h4>

          <p>
            THE experts took it much faster,
            cleared the lot with one jump
            and landed on the back wheel,
            keeping the front wheel off the
            ground until they had things
            perfectly under control.

            Alex Woods was another of
            Irish competitors who showed up
            well earning fourth place in the
            350 race and fifth, after Williams,
            in the 500 race on his fast 350
            machine. Ernie Lyons did well to
            drive a “wedge” amongst the four
            Dot works men in the 250 race but
            it appeared to me that his N.S.U.
            did not have the speed of the Dots,
            and he appeared to tire, possibly
            through having to work so hard
            with a slower machine.
          </p>
          <p>
            The surprise of the meeting was
            the great improvement in the riding
            of Eric Williams, brother of Ian.
            His win in the handicap was well
            merited.

            Revenue Is a big difficulty for
            clubs here as the big events are
            road races where no admission
            charge is possible, but I think that
            more events of the Moto-Cross
            variety, which are run on enclosed
            circuits where a charge can be col-
            lected, may at least be part of the!
            answer.
          </p>


          <h4>BIG ATTENDANCE</h4>

          <p>
            THIS type of sport is a novelty to
            Irish people, but there was
            quite a big attendance on Satur-
            day, and as word gets around as
            to its value its appeal will
            increase.
          </p>

          <p>
            I know that the calendar is
            already very full, but it might be
            worth while dropping some other
            events in favour of the Moto-Cross,
            and now is the time to plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the last of the racing season
            events on Saturday, the 5OO
            M.R.C.I. car meeting in Ulster, the
            trials season opens in a big way
            this month.
          </p>
          <p>
            For bikes there are three champion-
            ship trials in October, the Belfast and
            District Club’s, Barr Trophy (6th),
            the Dublin and District Club’s,
            Moran Cup (13th), and the Ulster
            President’s Cup (27th).
          </p>
          <p>
            On Saturday in the Dublin area
            there is the Dublin University Club’s,
            Fall Trial, starting from Lamb
            Doyles (3.0). For cars on Saturday
            there is the Leinster Club’s, Vigzol
            Cup Trial, a non-observed event,
            starting from the Phoenix Monument
            (3.0).
          </p>
          <p>
            on Sunday there is the first of the
            trials counting towards this season’s
            Hewison Trophy competition, the
            Limerick Club’s Circuit of Clare,
            which this year takes the place in
            the series of the same club’s Circuit
            of Munster. The other Hewison event
            this month is the Kilkenny Winter
            Trial (28th).

            B.S.A. Works Team For
            D. And D. Meeting
          </h2>

          <p>
            B.S.A.’s have just announced their
            intention of sending over an
            official works team for the Dublin
            and District Motor Cycle Club’s
            International Moto Cross meeting
            over the new course at Red Bog
            later in the month and this news
            will certainly give a terrific boost
            to the already highly interesting
            programme.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Birmingham factory will be
            represented by the high ranking
            English stars, Brian Stonebridge,
            David Tye and Terry Cheshire all
            of whom will be supplied with
            Senior and Junior " Gold Stars.”
            Cheshire and Tye were both seen
            in action at the Curragh last year,
            but Stonebridge, who is in the
            world championship class will be
            making his first appearance on our
            soil.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enquiries have also been received
            from Dutch and German riders and
            it is quite possible that a number
            of them will make the trip to
            Ireland immediately after the con-
            clusion of the International Six
            Days’ Trial on the Continent.
            Well-known Ulster men already
            included in the colourful line-up are
            Alex McFarland-Woods, Brian Cross
            and Alan Bradshaw while the cross-
            Channel Dot team have asked for
            special permission to compete in all
            classes. Fortunately there is a
            clause in the regulations which
            makes a proviso giving visitors a
            special concession in this respect so
            that Bill Barugh and his team
            mates will be able to face the
            starter as often as they wish.
          </p>
          <p>
            And indeed, judging by some of
            their outstanding performances in
            the past, it is safe to say that
            these 197 c.c. two-strokers will be
            more than a match for many of
            their heavyweight rivals.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the strongest Irish teams
            should be the Ariel trio, nominated
            by Mr. Ted Barrett, of Mountjoy
            Motor Cycles, Ltd. This very fast
            line-up consists of Des. Cullen and
            the Williams’ brothers, Ian and Eric,
            who have been riding with such dis-
            tinction during the past few seasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Phibsboro’ sponsor has always
            been very closely connected with the
            sport, and any successes gained by
            his B.S.A. or Ariel nominees have
            been very well received by followers
            of all branches of the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the leading Dublin expo-
            nents have already sent in their
            entries, but it should be noted that
            the list will finally close on Satur-
            day, and no late entries can possibly
            be considered after that date. In-
            deed. by the looks of things, it may
            well happen that some prospective
            competitors will have to be included
            amongst the reserves if nominations
            continue to pour in at the present.
