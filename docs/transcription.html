            <p> CHAMPIONSHIP CHALLENGER . . . Dublin rider Ian Williams (Ariel) who rides in
              to-morrow’s Hurst Cup International Trial at Conling, Belfast. </p>
            <h2>Hurst Cup Trial Has Big English Entry</h2>
            <h3>By BASIL BRINDLEY</h3>
            <p> WITH an entry of 79 for to-morrow’s Hurst Cup Trial, officials of the Knock Motor
              Cycle Club must be feeling very happy, as 80 is the maximum figure specified on the
              regulations. </p>
            <p> The international event will be held over a number of laps in the Clandeboye Estate,
              Belfast, and total distance will be somewhat less than 50 miles. </p>
            <p>English competitors did exceptionally well last year and, judging by the increase in
              their numbers on this occasion, they intend to return with the valuable perpetual
              trophy for another 12 months.</p>
            <p>The Sunbeam Motor Cycle Club is responsible for no less than seven members of the
              eighteen- strong cross - Channel challenge. Included in this team are Johnny Brittain
              (Royal Enfield), P. H. Alves (Triumph), B. W. Martin (B.S.A.) and the Wicken brothers
              who will be Norman and Triumph- mounted.</p>
            <p> Scotsman J. H. Birrell has entered a junior " Gold Star" while other visitors of
              note are E. Usher (Match- less), G. L. Jackson (A.J.S.), E. W. Smith (Francis Barnett)
              and J. V. Smith (B.S.A.) </p>
            <p> Leinster will be represented by practically every outstanding rider in the province
              and regulars like Dudley Ryder (Matchless), Joe Dawson (B.S.A.), Mick Tracey (Norton),
              Freddie Dickson (Sun) and Kevin Keegan (B.S.A.) may be relied upon to acquit
              themselves well. and J. V. Smith (B.S.A.) </p>
            <h5>Strong Ulster Bid</h5>
            <p> Travelling up from the south also with good reputations are Dave Felton (Francis
              Barnett), Ian Williams, Reg Armstrong (Gilera) and James exponents Ernie Lyons, Doug
              Ewen and Aubrey Archer. </p>
            <p> WITH an entry of 79 for to-morrow’s Hurst Cup Trial, officials of the Knock Motor
              Cycle Club must be feeling very happy, as 80 is the maximum figure specified on the
              regulations. </p>
            <p> With over 50 p.c. Of the entry, Ulster is in a strong position and if a Six-County
              man is to win the event, it’s odds on Sammy Miller from Belfast being the one to do
              it. Riding a 197 c.c, James, this road racing and trials star has proved himself
              almost invincible during the season and he must have an outstanding chance to- morrow. </p>
            <p> Able support will come from Bill Clark (Royal Enfield). Tommy Robb (Francis
              Barnett), W. J. Hutton (Greeves), Terry Hill (B.S.A.), Brian McClery (Royal Enfield)
              and Bertie Mann (Francis Barnett), all of whom have been figuring well in this year’s
              events. </p>
            <p> The trial begins at 12 o’clock and starting point is near the Lead Mines, Conling. </p>

            <h2> Moto-Cross Was Great Success </h2>
            <h3> BY BARRY MASON</h3>
            <p> THE outstanding success of the Dublin and District Motor Cycle Club's Moto-Cross
              last Saturday indicated that there is a bright future in this country for such an
              event </p>
            <p> Irish riders’ lack of practice was obvious and if they are to hold their own in the
              future there must be more events for training. It was very interesting to see how
              quickly some of them "caught on” last Satur- day. The outstanding Irish competi- tor
              was Ian Williams, who has had some experience recently in Eng- land, where he was
              riding for the Ariel factory. </p>
            <p> The most obvious things that our men have to learn are. keep- ing the taps open and
              front wheel control. It was wonderful to see how the British experts could con- trol
              their bikes at higher speeds than those at which many of our men were losing control
              of their machines. </p>
            <p> Front wheel lifting seems to be the answer. At one particularly tricky point, the
              course crossed a lane. Here the less experienced were “ jumping ” their machines at
              the start of the crossing, landing on the far side of the lane and “ jumping ” a
              second time </p>
            <h5>MUCH QUICKER</h5>
            <p> THE experts took it much faster, cleared the lot with one jump and landed on the
              back wheel, keeping the front wheel off the ground until they had things perfectly
              under control. </p>
            <p> Alex Woods was another of Irish competitors who showed up well earning fourth place
              in the 350 race and fifth, after Williams, in the 500 race on his fast 350 machine.
              Ernie Lyons did well to drive a “wedge” amongst the four Dot works men in the 250 race
              but it appeared to me that his N.S.U. did not have the speed of the Dots, and he
              appeared to tire, possibly through having to work so hard with a slower machine. </p>
            <p> The surprise of the meeting was the great improvement in the riding of Eric
              Williams, brother of Ian. His win in the handicap was well merited. </p>
            <p> Revenue Is a big difficulty for clubs here as the big events are road races where no
              admission charge is possible, but I think that more events of the Moto-Cross variety,
              which are run on enclosed circuits where a charge can be col- lected, may at least be
              part of the! answer. </p>
            <h5>BIG ATTENDANCE</h5>
            <p> THIS type of sport is a novelty to Irish people, but there was quite a big
              attendance on Satur- day, and as word gets around as to its value its appeal will
              increase. </p>
            <p> I know that the calendar is already very full, but it might be worth while dropping
              some other events in favour of the Moto-Cross, and now is the time to plan. </p>
            <p> With the last of the racing season events on Saturday, the 5OO M.R.C.I. car meeting
              in Ulster, the trials season opens in a big way this month. </p>
            <p> For bikes there are three champion- ship trials in October, the Belfast and District
              Club’s, Barr Trophy (6th), the Dublin and District Club’s, Moran Cup (13th), and the
              Ulster President’s Cup (27th). </p>
            <p> On Saturday in the Dublin area there is the Dublin University Club’s, Fall Trial,
              starting from Lamb Doyles (3.0). For cars on Saturday there is the Leinster Club’s,
              Vigzol Cup Trial, a non-observed event, starting from the Phoenix Monument (3.0). </p>
            <p> on Sunday there is the first of the trials counting towards this season’s Hewison
              Trophy competition, the Limerick Club’s Circuit of Clare, which this year takes the
              place in the series of the same club’s Circuit of Munster. The other Hewison event
              this month is the Kilkenny Winter Trial (28th). </p>

            <h3>Dublin And District Motor Cycle Club Had Day Out</h3>
            <p>CONGRATULATIONS to the Dublin and District Motor Cycle <br/> Club whose
              International Moto Cross meeting on Saturday <br/> last was one of the most
              entertaining fixtures of the season.<br/> the course at Redbog was ideally suited for
              this sport and many <br/> of the English works riders described it as one of the
              <br /> best in Europe. </p>
            <p>In the light og such an enthusi-<br/>astic reception it is now very much <br/> more
              than a possibility that next<br/> year's meeting will be included on <br/> the world
              championship table with <br/> the result that we may have a <br/> unique invasion of
              manufacturers <br/> teams including leading English<br/> and Continental
              exponents.<br/></p>
            <p>As expected the B.S.A and the Dot<br/> nominees made a clean sweep in<br/> the last
              three scratch races on Satur-<br/> day last but quite a few names were made by
              Irishmen whose pre-<br/> vious experience was gained from <br/> dabbling in other
              branches of the<br/> game together with a mere handful <br/> of scrambles.<br/></p>
            <p>Perhaps the most impressive was <br/> Harry O'Reilly's son, Frank, who<br/> rode
              his Lightweight Tandon with <br/> an unbounded exuberance which <br/> made quite a
              few of the stars, and <br/> in particular Bill Barugh of the <br/> Dot team, sit up
              and take note <br/> After figuring prominently in the <br/> qualifying heat Frank
              put every- <br/> thing he knew into the final and <br/> going into the lead on the
              third lap <br/> he stayed in front until the last half mile where he was headed by
              <br/> Eric Williams on the Mountjoy<br/> entered Ariel.</p>
            <h5> FIGURED PROMINENTLY</h5>
            <p>If he continues to improve at <br/> the present rate there is little <br/> doubt
              that Frank O'Reilly could <br/> turn out to be a really top class <br/> Moto Cross
              and Road Racing star <br/> He has certainly put his Grasstrack <br/> experience to
              great use and his long distance road racing debut on the Brian Somers B.S.A at
              this<br/> year's Skerries "100" gave some indication of the Dubliner's ability</p>
            <p>The Williams brothers, Ian and <br/> Eric also caught the eye on Saturday <br/>
              last and both of them figured promi-<br/> nently in the awards list. Indeed <br/>
              were it not for the fact that Eric <br/> had shown such a terrific improve-<br/>ment
              in his riding he could never <br/> have overhauled Frank O'Reilly in<br/> order to
              capture the Freeman </p>
            <p>in the general handicap final.</p>
            <p>Ian, who rode at several cross <br/> Channel meetings last season was <br/> the
              fastest Irishman of the day as <br/> he took Ted Barret's other Ariel into <br/>
              fourth place in the Senior scratch <br/> race despite a heavy tumbe en route<br/> He
              also occupied a similar position <br/> in the general handicap and con <br/>
              sidering that he was riding off such <br/> a short mark of one and a half <br/>
              minutes he did extremely well to get the flag so near to Brian Stone-<br/>bridge the
              B.S.A expert.<br/>
            </p>
            <p>The evergreen Ernie Lyons gave <br/> the huge crowds plenty to enthuse <br/> over
              in the 250 c.c. event and his <br/> fourth position behind three of the <br/> Dot
              men and in front of another <br/> of them calls for honourable men-<br/>tion
              Unfortunately Freddie Dixon<br/> who was also expected to do well in <br/> the same
              event broke his frame on<br/> the first lap and took no further <br/> part in the
              proceedings</p>
            <h5>NORTHERN SUCCESSES</h5>
            <p>Several Ulster riders hit the <br/> headlines during the afternoon.<br/> the most
              successful of them being <br/> Alex McFarland Woods from Bel- <br/>fast who finished
              fourth to the B.S.A. team in the 350 c.c. scratch<br/> race fifth to Ian Williams and
              the <br/> same trio in the Senior event and <br/> sixth in the genereal handicap all
              on a Junior 'Gold Star".</p>
            <p>Alan Bradshaw made news with his <br/> Francis-Barnett when taking a very <br/>
              creditable sixth in the opening en-<br/> counter and he finished up the day <br/> as
              eight man home in the general <br/> handicap with a comparatively <br/> short
              allowance of one lap.</p>
            <p>The Car Trials season gets into its <br/> stride this weekend when the Lein-<br/>
              ster Motor Club holds it Vigzol Cup <br/> meeting over a 60 mile course start-<br/>
              ing in the Phoenix Park at 3 p.m<br/> on Saturday. Navigation by Ordnance <br/>
              Survey sheets No. 16 and 13 will play <br/> an important part in prodeedings <br/>
              and references by the old and new <br/> grid system will be supplied to
              com<br/>petitors</p>
            <p>Sunday's Circuit of Clare T <br/> which starts from Limerick at<br/> a.m. wukk narj
              tge beginning<br/> Hewison Trophy competition and<br/> because of this all leading
              Dublin<br/> and Provincial enthusiasts are ex-<br/>pected to make the journey for
              this<br/> well supported fixture.</p>

            <h2> B.S.A. Works Team For D. And D. Meeting </h2>
            <p> B.S.A.’s have just announced their intention of sending over an official works team
              for the Dublin and District Motor Cycle Club’s International Moto Cross meeting over
              the new course at Red Bog later in the month and this news will certainly give a
              terrific boost to the already highly interesting programme. </p>
            <p> The Birmingham factory will be represented by the high ranking English stars, Brian
              Stonebridge, David Tye and Terry Cheshire all of whom will be supplied with Senior and
              Junior " Gold Stars.” Cheshire and Tye were both seen in action at the Curragh last
              year, but Stonebridge, who is in the world championship class will be making his first
              appearance on our soil. </p>
            <p> Enquiries have also been received from Dutch and German riders and it is quite
              possible that a number of them will make the trip to Ireland immediately after the
              con- clusion of the International Six Days’ Trial on the Continent. Well-known Ulster
              men already included in the colourful line-up are Alex McFarland-Woods, Brian Cross
              and Alan Bradshaw while the cross- Channel Dot team have asked for special permission
              to compete in all classes. Fortunately there is a clause in the regulations which
              makes a proviso giving visitors a special concession in this respect so that Bill
              Barugh and his team mates will be able to face the starter as often as they wish. </p>
            <p> And indeed, judging by some of their outstanding performances in the past, it is
              safe to say that these 197 c.c. two-strokers will be more than a match for many of
              their heavyweight rivals. </p>
            <p> One of the strongest Irish teams should be the Ariel trio, nominated by Mr. Ted
              Barrett, of Mountjoy Motor Cycles, Ltd. This very fast line-up consists of Des. Cullen
              and the Williams’ brothers, Ian and Eric, who have been riding with such dis- tinction
              during the past few seasons. </p>
            <p> The Phibsboro’ sponsor has always been very closely connected with the sport, and
              any successes gained by his B.S.A. or Ariel nominees have been very well received by
              followers of all branches of the game. </p>
            <p> Most of the leading Dublin expo- nents have already sent in their entries, but it
              should be noted that the list will finally close on Satur- day, and no late entries
              can possibly be considered after that date. In- deed. by the looks of things, it may
              well happen that some prospective competitors will have to be included amongst the
              reserves if nominations continue to pour in at the present. </p>

          <div>
               <h5>The best Last.</h5>
               <p>For some reason, as yet un-<br> explained, the graded scratch<br> races which normally open the pro-<br>gramme, where the last events to be <br> contested at Sunday's open
                     grass<br> track, organised by the Dalcassian <br>
                     M.C.C., and run over an entirely <br> new course at Clonmoney, bun-<br>ratty. And,
                  whereas the official pro-<br>gramme proclaimed that four of <br> these events
                  should be run, in fact, there were only two. </p>
               <p>It was the second and fastest of these that the finest
                  <br> racing of the season so far was <br>witnessed. For nearly three laps,
                  Willie Harris, that most likeable <br> lanky
                  County Dublin farmer – whose <br> extreme shyness in
                  company con-<br>trasts strangely with his tigerish <br> determination in the
                  saddle – held <br> an incredible lead over Mervyn <br>
                     Hayes and Ian Williams. The <br>
                  magnitudeof Harris's achievement <br> will be
                  obvious when it is realised <br> that both Williams and Hayes
                  <br> straddled highly specialised J.A.P.
                  <br> engined grasstrack specials of 500 <br> c.c., while
                  Harris was mounted on a <br> virtually standard–though
                  admit-<br>dely dope-burning – Gold Star B.S.A. of only 350 c.c. </p>
               <p>Eventually, both J.A.P.'s got past the B.S.A. and spectator interest <br>
                  shifted from incredulous admira-<br>tion of Harris's
                  David versus <br> Goliath act, to palpitations and Hayes.
                  For two laps <br> Williams, unused to defeat in any <br> class,
                  strove mightily to get past <br> his opponent, who enjoyed the ad-<br>vantage of
                  an early lead. But <br> Hayes, one of the jolliest of men, <br> grinning impishly
                  all the time, was <br> as willing to ride on the verge of <br> disaster as the
                  other, and won <br> narrowly. The gallant Harris was
                  third.... This was a great race! <br>* * *
               </p>
            </div>

            <div>
               <h5>The Other Events.</h5>
               <p>Only less exciting by comparison <br> with such heart-stopping stuff <br> were
                  the other events on the pro-<br>gramme. Ian Williams had dam-<br>aged the rear suspension of his <br> fleet Barnett in practice, and was a
                  <br> non-starter in the 250 class, as <br> were the Freddie Dickson-Geary<br>
                  Scarlet Dot equippe, who failed to <br> turn up, so the reliable Jimmy <br> Kavanagh had a
                  little trouble in <br> bringing his Francis Barnett (the <br> only one in the country besides <br>William's) into first place.<br> He was followed
                  hime by Michael <br> Smurfit on the screaming Dodder
                  <br> (a twin-cylinder Akder engine in a <br> Dot frame). Third place went to <br> Limerick's Don Kelly on the ex-<br> Harrington James. There wasn't<br> much real
                  opposition in this class <br> – Tommy Griffin's Excelsior was <br> windbroken. Corkman
                  Pat O'Shea's Jawa-engined special was temper-<br> amental. and, despite neat
                  riding, <br> Joe MacMahon could do little on <br> an underpowered James. <br>
                  * * *
               </p>
            </div>

            <div>
               * * * <br> <h5>Spills and Other Things</h5>
               <p>Ian Williams beat Mervyn Hayes<br> in the 500 c.c. scratch race.
                Eric <br> Williams, on another J.A.P, was a <br> comfortable second until he spilled.<br>
                George Harris was a good third. <br> Two lads from Cork Club found <br> their way into the
                Munster riders' <br> handicap, and took first and second <br> places, after Don Kelly, who was leading by a street, spilled through <br> over-eagerness. Actually the Naas
                <br> men should not have been allowed<br> to ride in this event, which was<br>
                originally intended for residents in<br> the province of
                Munster only. That <br> remark is not intended to belittle <br> the achievement of Con Hederman,<br> who also took first place in the <br> all-comer's handicap, in which event<br>
                Dermot Byrne of Dublin, out for the
                <br> first time since sustaining a thumb <br> injury at the last Dalcassian meet-<br> ing in
                Nenagh, took second place, <br> as well as winning his heat. <br> * * *
               </p>
               <p>Byrne, in fact, had a real field <br> day, because he also
                  took first <br> place in graded scratch race A, <br>
                  and Limerick's Dan Kelly had the<br> distinction of running into more<br> places than any other rider. Of <br> the remaining Limerickmen, Mick<br> MacEoin was foolish enough
                  to <br> meddle in a major way with his <br> peak-conquering James on the day<br> before the event, in quest of more <br> speed, with the result that the un-<br> fortunate engine gave up
                  the ghost<br> of Sunday during the first practice <br> lap. Matt
                     Murphy did his best with <br> the same detuned James as Joe <br> McMahon.
               </p>
               <p>The Automobile Association sign-<br>posing was, if anything, better<br> than ever, and the Red Cross and <br> Garda Siochana played their ex-<br> pected reliable parts
                  Without <br> these and other voluntary helpers, <br> including the timekeepers,
                  Mr. and <br> Mrs. and the Misses O'Reilly, it <br> would be
                  impossible to run a de-<br>cent grasstrack. May their gener-<br> osity be rewarded!<br>

            <h4>SUNDAY REVIEW</h4>
            <h4>MOTOR-CYCLING... BY BR</h4>
            <h2> Big Test Nenagh </h2>
            <p> AT three o’clock this afternoon, the first 1958 motor-cycle grass-track event will
              get under way at Drummin Field, just outside Nenagh town. </p>
            <p> This is the first time that such an honour has fallen to a provincial club. </p>
            <p> And it is due to the fact that the I.M.C.C. date scheduled for yesterday was
              abandoned because the usual course at Hazelhatch was not available. </p>
            <p> The Ormond M.C.C., who organise to-day’s event, are a newly-formed club and have
              never run any kind of open event before. </p>
            <h5>DOT TWINS</h5>
            <p> Some idea of the fare to be expected can be had from the performances in last week’s
              Dunlop scramble. </p>
            <p> Chief interest is in the 250 c.c. class, where the newly imported Dot twins in the
              hands of Jack Kavenagh and Gerald Scarlett do battle with the new A.M.C. engined
              Francis Barnetts, ridden by Ian Williams and Jim Kavenagh. </p>
            <p> Ian Williams is Ariel- mounted in the 500 c.c. class. </p>
            <p> The competition comes from his brother, Eric, who rides either an Ariel or a
              JAP-engined special, and George Harps, also Ariel- mounted. </p>
            <p> Dermot Byrne rides his recently acquired JAP. </p>
            <h5>LOCAL MEN</h5>
            <p> Local interest is in Dalcassian riders McEoin (James), Kelly (James), Len- non
              (Norton). </p>
            <p> Early entries close to- morrow for the Limerick Motor Club’s Circuit of Munster, the
              annual car rally held over the Whit week-end. </p>
            <p> This year’s event takes the same form as that of pre- vious years—about 600 miles of
              driving in two days. </p>
            <p> There are four starting points — Cork, Limerick, Dublin, and Urlingford. </p>
            <h5>BIG ENTRY</h5>
            <p> THERE is a big entry for the Athlone Hockey Club’s annual mixed 6-a-side tournament
              at Grace Park, Athlone, to-day. </p>

            <h2> Isle of Man Win For Miller? </h2>
            <p> THIS week sees the annual mecca of motor- cyclists in full swing. The Isle of Man TT
              week is just as attractive as ever and Irish- men are likely to be as prominent as
              usual. </p>
            <p> We stand a good chance of seeing Sammy Miller finish in front this year. He will be
              riding a 125 c.c Ducati in the ultra light- weight event over Clypse on Wednesday. </p>
            <p> In the 250 c.c. event he rides a Czechoslovakian CZ and his competition will include
              two other Ulster riders who should not be too far behind—Tommy Robb and Davy Andrews,
              who ride N.S.U.s entered by Tommy Hill. </p>
            <h5>FAVOURITE</h5>
            <p> Another Ulsterman rides in both senior and junior events on an A.J.S. (350) and a
              Norton (500). </p>
            <p> Judging by practice times last week, it seems that John (Illegible) must be a
              favourite for the senior honours of the week on a works M.V. Augusta. </p>
            <p> Irish fans, returning from the Island immediately after the I.O.M. racing, will move
              straight to Butlin’s Holiday Camp, Mosney, where the Dublin and Dis- trict M.C.C. hold
              their annual championship meet- ing next Saturday. </p>
            <h5>BIG SURPRISE</h5>
            <p> Included in the programme will be the National two- mile 500 c.c. and 250 c.c.
              championships, as well as the 350 c.c. southern centre one. </p>
            <p> I expect Davy Dixon to retain this title, but if a southerner comes out on top in
              either of the others it will be a big surprise. </p>
            <p> Ian Williams, on the Francis Barnett, might just manage it in the 250 race. </p>
            <p> Racing starts at 3.30 and will conclude at about 5.45 p.m. </p>
