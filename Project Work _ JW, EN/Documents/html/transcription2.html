               <h2>Hurst Cup Trial Has<br/> Big English Entry</h2>

                  BRINDLEY</h5>
            
            
               <p>WITH an entry of 79 for to-morrow’s Hurst Cup Trial,<br/> officials of the Knock Motor Cycle Club must be<br/> feeling very happy, as 80 is the
                  maximum figure<br/> specified on the regulations.</p>
            
            
            
               <p>The international event<br/> will be held over a number of<br/> laps
                  in the Clandeboye<br/> Estate, Belfast, and total<br/>
                  distance will be somewhat<br/> less than 50 miles.</p>
               <p>English competitors did excep-<br/> tionally well last year and,<br/> judging by
                  the increase in their<br/> numbers on this occasion, they<br/> intend to return
                  with the valuable<br/> perpetual trophy for another 12<br/> months.</p>
               <p>The Sunbeam Motor Cycle Club<br/> is
                  responsible for no less than<br/> seven members of the eighteen-<br/> strong cross
                  -Channel challenge.<br/> Included in this team are Johnny<br/>
                     Brittain (Royal Enfield),
                     P. H.<br/> Alves (Triumph), B. W. Martin<br/> ( B.S.A.) and the Wicken
                  brothers<br/> who will be Norman and
                     Triumph-<br/> mounted.</p>
               <p>Scotsman J. H. Birrell has entered<br/> a junior "Gold Star" while other<br/> visitors of note
                  are E. Usher (Match-<br/>
                     less), G. L. Jackson (A.J.S.), E. W.<br/> Smith
                     (Francis Barnett) and J.
                     V.<br/> Smith (B.S.A.)<br/> Leinster will be represented by<br/> practically every
                  outstanding rider in<br/> the province and regulars like Dudley<br/>
                     Ryder (Matchless),
                     Joe Dawson<br/> (
                     B.S.A.), Mick Tracey (Norton),<br/>
                  Freddie Dickson (Sun) and Kevin<br/> Keegan (B.S.A.) may be relied upon<br/> to acquit
                  themselves well.</p>
            


            
               <h5>Strong Ulster Bid</h5>
               <p>Travelling up from the south also<br/> with good reputations are
                     Dave<br/> Felton ( Francis
                     Barnett), Ian<br/> Williams,
                     Reg Armstrong (Gilera)<br/>
                  and James exponents
                     Ernie Lyons,<br/>
                  Doug Ewen and Aubrey Archer.</p>
               <p>With over 50 p.c. of the entry,<br/>
                  Ulster is in a strong position and<br/> if a Six-County man
                   is to win the<br/> event,
                  it’s odds on Sammy Miller<br/> from
                     Belfast being the one to do<br/> it. Riding a
                     197 c.c, James, this<br/> road
                  racing and trials star has<br/> proved himself almost invincible<br/> during the
                  season and he must<br/> have an outstanding chance to-<br/> morrow.</p>

               <p>Able support will come from Bill<br/> Clark (Royal Enfield). Tommy
                  Robb<br/> ( Francis
                  Barnett), W. J. Hutton<br/> (Greeves), Terry Hill
                     (B.S.A.), Brian<br/>
                     McClery (Royal Enfield)
                  and Bertie<br/> Mann (Francis
                     Barnett), all of whom<br/> have been figuring well in this
                  year’s<br/> events.</p>
               <p>The trial begins at 12 o’clock and<br/> starting point is near the Lead
                     Mines,<br/> Conling.</p>

               <h2>Motor Sport Review</h2>

               <h2> Moto-Cross Was<br/> Great Success</h2>

               <h5> BY BARRY MASON</h5>
            
            
            
               <p>THE outstanding success of the<br/>
                  Dublin and District Motor Cycle<br/> Club's Moto-Cross
                  last Saturday<br/> indicated that there is a bright<br/> future in this country
                  for such<br/> an event</p>

               <p>Irish riders’ lack of practice was<br/> obvious and if they are to hold<br/> their
                  own in the future there must<br/> be more events for training. It was<br/> very
                  interesting to see how quickly<br/> some of them "caught on” last Satur-<br/> day.
                  The outstanding Irish competi-<br/> tor was Ian
                     Williams, who has had<br/> some experience recently in
                     Eng-<br/> land, where he was riding for the<br/> Ariel
                  factory.</p>


               <p>The most obvious things that<br/> our men have to
                     learn are. keep-<br/> ing the taps open and front wheel<br/> control. It was
                     wonderful to see<br/> how the British experts could con-<br/> trol their bikes
                     at higher speeds<br/> than those at which many of our<br/> men were losing
                     control of their<br/> machines.</p>

               <p>Front wheel lifting seems to be<br/> the answer. At one particularly<br/> tricky
                  point, the course crossed a<br/> lane. Here the less experienced were<br/> “
                  jumping ” their machines at the<br/> start of the crossing, landing on the<br/>
                  far side of the lane and “ jumping ”<br/> a second time</p>
            

            

               <h5>MUCH QUICKER</h5>

               <p>
                  THE experts took it much faster,<br/> cleared the
                  lot with one jump<br/> and landed on the back wheel,<br/> keeping the front wheel
                  off the<br/> ground until they had things<br/> perfectly under control.</p>

               <p>Alex Woods was another of<br/> Irish competitors who showed
                  up<br/> well earning fourth place in the<br/> 350 race and fifth, after Williams,<br/> in the 500 race on his fast 350<br/>
                  machine. Ernie Lyons did well to<br/> drive a “wedge” amongst
                  the four<br/>
                  Dot works men in the 250 race but<br/>
                  it appeared to me that his N.S.U.<br/>
                  did not have the speed of the Dots,<br/> and he appeared to tire,
                  possibly through having to work so hard<br/> with a
                  slower machine.</p>

               <p> The surprise of the meeting was<br/> the great improvement in the riding<br/> of
                     Eric Williams, brother of Ian.<br/> His win in the handicap was well<br/> merited.</p>
               <p> Revenue is a big difficulty for<br/> clubs here as the big events are<br/> road
                  races where no admission<br/> charge is possible, but I think that<br/> more
                  events of the Moto-Cross<br/> variety, which are run on enclosed<br/> circuits
                  where a charge can be col-<br/> lected, may at least be part of the<br/>
                  answer.</p>
            

            

               <h5>BIG ATTENDANCE</h5>

               <p><i>THIS type of sport is a novelty
                     to<br/> Irish people, but there was<br/> quite a big attendance on
                        Satur-<br/> day, and as word gets around as<br/> to its
                     value its appeal will<br/> increase.</i></p>

               <p>I know that the calendar is<br/> already very full, but it might be<br/> worth
                  while dropping some other<br/> events in favour of the Moto-Cross,<br/> and now is
                  the time to plan.</p>

               <p><b>With the last of the racing season<br/> events on Saturday, the
                        5OO<br/>
                        M.R.C.I. car meeting in
                        Ulster, the<br/> trials season opens in a big
                     way<br/> this month.</b></p>

               <p>For bikes there are three champion-<br/> ship trials in October, the
                     Belfast and<br/>
                  District Club’s, Barr Trophy
                     (6th),<br/> the Dublin and District Club’s,<br/>
                  Moran Cup (13th), and the Ulster<br/>
                  President’s Cup (27th).</p>

               <p>On Saturday in the Dublin area<br/> there is the Dublin University Club’s,<br/>
                  Fall Trial, starting from Lamb<br/> Doyles (3.0). For cars on Saturday<br/> there is the Leinster Club’s, Vigzol<br/> Cup
                     Trial, a non-observed event,<br/> starting from the Phoenix Monument<br/> (3.0).</p>

               <p>On Sunday there is the first of the<br/> trials counting towards this season’s<br/>
                  Hewison Trophy competition, the<br/>
                  Limerick Club’s
                  Circuit of Clare,<br/> which this year takes the place
                  in<br/> the series of the same club’s Circuit<br/> of
                     Munster. The other Hewison event<br/> this month
                  is the Kilkenny Winter<br/> Trial
                  (28th). </p>

            <h2>Dublin And District Motor<br/> Cycle Club Had Day Out</h2>
            
               <p>CONGRATULATIONS to the
                     Dublin and District Motor Cycle <br/> Club whose International Moto Cross meeting on Saturday <br/> last was one of the
                  most entertaining fixtures of the season. <br/> the course at
                     Redbog was ideally suited for this sport and many <br/>
                  of the English works ridersdescribed it as one of the
                  <br/> best in  Europe. <br/>
               </p>

            
            
               
               <p>In the light og such an enthusi-<br/>astic reception it is now very much <br/>
                  more than a possibility that next<br/> year's meeting will be included on <br/>
                  the world championship table with <br/> the result that
                  we may have a <br/> unique invasion of manufacturers <br/> teams including leading
                  English<br/> and Continental exponents.<br/></p>
               <p>As expected the B.S.A and the Dot<br/> nominees
                  made a clean sweep in<br/> the last three scratch races
                  on Satur-<br/> day last but quite a few names were made by Irishmen whose
                  pre-<br/> vious experience was gained from <br/> dabbling in other branches of
                  the<br/> game together with a mere handful <br/> of scrambles.<br/></p>
               <p>Perhaps the most impressive was <br/>
                  Harry O'Reilly's son, Frank, who<br/>
                  rode his Lightweight Tandon with <br/>
                  an unbounded exuberance which <br/> made quite a few of the stars, and <br/> in
                  particular Bill Barugh og the <br/>
                  Dot team, sit up and take note <br/> After figuring
                  prominently in the <br/> qualifying heat Frank put every-
                  <br/> thing he knew into the final and <br/> going into the lead on the third lap
                  <br/> he stayed in front until the last half mile where he was headed by <br/>
                  Eric Williams on the Mountjoy<br/> entered Ariel.<br/></p>
            
            
               <h2>
                   FIGURED PROMINENTLY</h2>
               <p> If he continues to improve at <br/> the present rate there is little
                  <br/> doubt that Frank O'Reilly could <br/> turn out to be a
                  really top class <br/> Moto Cross and Road Racing star <br/> He has certainly put
                  his Grasstrack <br/> experience to great use and his long distance road racing
                  debut on the Brian Somers B.S.A at this<br/> year's
                     Skerries "100" gave some indication of the Dubliner's
                  ability</p>
               <p>The Williams brothers, Ian and <br/>
                  Eric also caught the eye on Saturday <br/> last and
                  both of them figured promi-<br/> nently in the awards list. Indeed <br/> were it
                  not for the fact that Eric<br/> had shown such a
                  terrific improve-<br/>ment in his riding he could never <br/> have overhauled
                     Frank O'Reilly in<br/> order to capture the Freeman  Trophy in the general handicap final.</p>
               <p>Ian, who rode at several cross
                     <br/> Channel meetings last season was <br/> the fastest Irishman of the
                  dat as <br/> he took Ted Barret's other Ariel into <br/> fourth place in the Senior scratch <br/> race despite a heavy tumbe en
                  route<br/> He also occupied a similar position <br/> in the general handicap and
                  con <br/> sidering that he was riding off such <br/> a short mark of one and a
                  half <br/> minutes he did extremely well to get the flag so near to
                     Brian Stone- <br/>bridge the B.S.A expert.<br/>
               </p>
               <p>The evergreen Ernie Lyons gave <br/> the huge crowds plenty
                  to enthuse <br/> over in the 250 c.c. event and his <br/>
                  fourth position behind three of the <br/> Dot men and in
                  front of another <br/> of them calls for honourable men-<br/>tion Unfortunately
                     Freddie Dixon<br/> who was also expected to do well in
                  <br/> the same event broke his frame on<br/> the first lap and took no further
                  <br/> part in the proceedings</p>
            
            
               <h5><b>NORTHERN SUCCESSES</b></h5>
               <p>Several Ulster riders hit the <br/> headlines during the
                  afternoon.<br/> the most successful of them being <br/>
                  Alex McFarland Woods from Bel-
                     <br/>fast who finished fourth to the B.S.A. team in the 350
                     c.c. scratch<br/> race fifth to Ian
                     Williams and the <br/> same trio in the Senior
                     event and <br/> sixth in the genereal handicap all on a Junior 'Gold Star".</p>
               <p>Alan Bradshaw made news with his <br/>
                  Francis-Barnett when taking a very
                  <br/> creditable sixth in the opening en-<br/> counter and he finished up the day
                  <br/> as eight man home in the general <br/> handicap with a comparatively <br/>
                  short allowance of one lap.</p>
               <p>The Car Trials season gets into its <br/> stride this
                  weekend when the Lein-<br/> ster Motor Club holds it Vigzol Cup <br/> meeting over a 60 mile course start-<br/>
                  ing in the Phoenix Park at 3 p.m<br/> on
                  Saturday. Navigation by Ordnance <br/> Survey sheets No. 16 and 13 will play <br/>
                  an important part in prodeedings <br/> and references by the old and new <br/>
                  grid system will be supplied to com<br/>petitors</p>
               <p>Sunday's Circuit of Clare T <sup> [missing text]</sup>
                  <br/> which starts from Limerick at <sup> [missing text]</sup>
                  <br/> a.m. will mark the beginning of the
                  <br/>
                  Hewison Trophy competition
                   and<br/> because of this all leading

               <h2>B.S.A. Works Team For<br/> D. And D. Meeting</h2>
            

            
               <p>B.S.A.’s have just announced
                  their<br/> intention of sending over an<br/> official works team for the Dublin<br/> and District Motor Cycle
                     Club’s<br/> International Moto Cross meeting<br/> over the new course at
                     Red Bog<br/> later in the month and this news<br/> will
                  certainly give a terrific boost<br/> to the already highly interesting<br/>
                  programme.<br/></p>
               <p>The Birmingham factory will be<br/> represented by the high
                  ranking<br/> English stars, Brian Stonebridge,<br/>
                  David Tye and Terry Cheshire all<br/> of
                  whom will be supplied with<br/>
                  Senior and Junior " Gold Stars.”<br/>
                  Cheshire and Tye were both seen<br/> in
                  action at the Curragh last year,<br/> but
                     Stonebridge, who is in the<br/> world championship class
                  will be<br/> making his first appearance on our<br/> soil.<br/></p>
               <p>Enquiries have also been received<br/> from Dutch and German riders and<br/> it is
                  quite possible that a number<br/> of them will make the trip to<br/>
                  Ireland immediately after the con-<br/> clusion of the
                     International Six<br/> Days’ Trial on  the
                     Continent.<br/> Well-known Ulster men already<br/> included in the
                  colourful line-up are<br/>
                  Alex McFarland-Woods, Brian Cross<br/>
                  and Alan Bradshaw while the cross-<br/> Channel Dot team have asked for<br/> special permission to compete in
                  all<br/> classes. Fortunately there is a<br/> clause in the regulations which<br/>
                  makes a proviso giving visitors a<br/> special concession in this respect so<br/>
                  that Bill Barugh and his team<br/> mates will be able to face
                  the<br/> starter as often as they wish. </p>
               <p>And indeed, judging by some of<br/> their outstanding performances
                  in the past, it is safe to say that<br/> these 197 c.c. two-strokers will be<br/> more than a match for many
                  of<br/> their heavyweight rivals.</p>
               <p>One of the strongest Irish teams<br/> should be the Ariel
                  trio, nominated<br/> by Mr. Ted Barrett, of Mountjoy<br/> Motor Cycles, Ltd. This very
                  fast<br/> line-up consists of Des. Cullen and<br/> the
                     Williams’ brothers, Ian and Eric,<br/> who
                  have been riding with such dis-<br/> tinction during the past few seasons.<br/>
                  The Phibsboro’ sponsor has always<br/> been very closely
                  connected with the<br/> sport, and any successes gained by<br/> his B.S.A. or Ariel nominees have<br/> been very well received by
                  followers<br/> of all branches of the game.</p>
               <p> Most of the leading Dublin expo-<br/> nents have already
                  sent in their<br/> entries, but it should be noted that<br/> the list will finally
                  close on Satur-<br/> day, and no late entries can possibly<br/> be considered
                  after that date. In-<br/> deed. by the looks of things, it may<br/> well happen
                  that some prospective<br/> competitors will have to be included<br/> amongst the
                  reserves if nominations<br/> continue to pour in at the present.</p>

                  the last events to be <br/> contested at Sunday's open
                     grass<br/> track, organised by the Dalcassian <br/>
                     M.C.C., and run over an entirely <br/> new course at
                     Clonmoney, bun-<br/>ratty. And,
                  whereas the official pro-<br/>gramme proclaimed that four of <br/> these events
                  should be run, in fact, there were only two. </p>
               <p>It was the second and fastest of these that the finest
                  <br/> racing of the season so far was <br/>witnessed. For nearly three laps,
                     Willie Harris, that most likeable <br/> lanky
                     County Dublin farmer – whose <br/> extreme shyness in
                  company con-<br/>trasts strangely with his tigerish <br/> determination in the
                  saddle – held <br/> an incredible lead over Mervyn <br/>
                     Hayes and Ian Williams. The <br/>
                  magnitudeof Harris's achievement <br/> will be
                  obvious when it is realised <br/> that both Williams and Hayes
                  <br/> straddled highly specialised J.A.P.
                  <br/> engined grasstrack specials of 500 <br/> c.c., while
                     Harris was mounted on a <br/> virtually standard–though
                  admit-<br/>dely dope-burning – Gold Star
                     B.S.A. of only 350 c.c. </p>
               <p>Eventually, both J.A.P.'s got past the
                     B.S.A. and spectator interest <br/>
                  shifted from incredulous admira-<br/>tion of
                     Harris's
                  David versus <br/>
                  Goliath act, to palpitations
                  appre-<br/>hension regarding the outcome of<br/> the fierce struggle between
                     Wil-<br/>liams and Hayes.
                  For two laps <br/>
                  Williams, unused to defeat in any <br/> class,
                  strove mightily to get past <br/> his opponent, who enjoyed the ad-<br/>vantage of
                  an early lead. But <br/>
                  Hayes, one of the jolliest of men, <br/> grinning impishly
                  all the time, was <br/> as willing to ride on the verge of <br/> disaster as the
                  other, and won <br/> narrowly. The gallant Harris was
                  third.... This was a great race! <b>* * *</b>

               <h5>The Other Events.</h5>
               <p>Only less exciting by comparison <br/> with such heart-stopping stuff <br/> were
                  the other events on the pro-<br/>gramme. Ian
                     Williams had dam-<br/>aged the rear suspension of his <br/>
                  fleet Barnett in practice, and was a
                  <br/> non-starter in the 250 class, as <br/> were the Freddie
                     Dickson-Geary<br/>
                  Scarlet Dot equippe, who failed to
                  <br/> turn up, so the reliable Jimmy <br/> Kavanagh had a
                  little troulbe in <br/> bringing his Francis Barnett (the <br/> only one in the country besides <br/>
                  William's) into first place.<br/> He was followed
                  hime by Michael <br/> Smurfit on the screaming Dodder
                  <br/> (a twin-cylinder Akder engine in a <br/> Dot frame). Third place went to <br/>
                  Limerick's Don Kelly on the ex-<br/>
                  Harrington
                  James. There wasn't<br/> much real
                  opposition in this class <br/> – Tommy Griffin's Excelsior was <br/> windbroken. Corkman
                     Pat O'Shea's Jawa-engined
                     special was temper-<br/> amental. and, despite neat
                  riding, <br/>
                  Joe MacMahon could do little on <br/> an underpowered
                     James. <br/>

                  <br/><b>* * *</b>

                <h5> Spills and Other Things</h5>
               <p>Ian Williams beat Mervyn
                  Hayes<br/> in the 500 c.c. scratch race.
                     Eric <br/> Williams, on another J.A.P, was a <br/> comfortable second until he spilled.<br/>
                  George Harris was a good third. <br/> Two lads from Cork Club found <br/> their way into the
                     Munster riders' <br/> handicap, and took first and
                  second <br/> places, after Don Kelly, who was leading by a
                  street, spilled through <br/> over-eagerness. Actually the
                     Naas
                  <br/> men should not have been allowed<br/> to ride in this event, which was<br/>
                  originally intended for residents in<br/> the province of
                     Munster only. That <br/> remark is not intended to
                  belittle <br/> the achievement of Con Hederman,<br/> who also
                  took first place in the <br/> all-comer's handicap, in which event<br/>
                  Dermot
                     Byrne of Dublin, out for the
                   first time since sustaining a thumb <br/> injury at the last
                     Dalcassian meet-<br/> ing in
                     Nenagh, took second place, <br/> as well as winning his
                  heat. <br/>
                  <b>* * *</b>
               </p>
               <p>Byrne, in fact, had a real field <br/> day, because he also
                  took first <br/> place in graded scratch race A, <br/>
                  and Limerick's Dan Kelly had the<br/>
                  distinction of running into more<br/> places than any other rider. Of <br/> the
                  remaining Limerickmen, Mick<br/> MacEoin was foolish enough
                  to <br/> meddle in a major way with his <br/> peak-conquering James on the day<br/> before the event, in quest
                  of more <br/> speed, with the result that the un-<br/> fortunate engine gave up
                  the ghost<br/> of Sunday during the first practice <br/> lap. Matt
                     Murphy did his best with <br/> the same detuned James as Joe <br/> McMahon.
               </p>
               <p>The Automobile Association sign-<br/>posing was, if
                  anything, better<br/> than ever, and the Red Cross and <br/>
                  Garda Siochana played their ex-<br/> pected reliable parts
                  Without <br/> these and other voluntary helpers, <br/> including the timekeepers,
                  Mr. and <br/> Mrs. and the Misses O'Reilly, it <br/> would be
                  impossible to run a de-<br/>cent grasstrack. May their gener-<br/> osity be rewarded!<br/>

               <h2>MOTOR-CYCLING...</h2>

               <h5>BY BR</h5>

               <h2>Big Test<br/> Nenagh</h2>
            

            
               <p>AT three o’clock this afternoon, the
                  first 1958<br/>
                  motor-cycle grass-track event will get<br/> under way at
                     Drummin Field, just outside<br/>
                  Nenagh town.</p>
            
            

            
               <p> This is the first time that<br/> such an honour has fallen<br/> to a provincial
                  club.</p>
               <p>And it is due to the fact<br/> that the 
                        I.M.C.C
                        Irish Motorcycle Club
                     . date<br/> scheduled for yesterday was<br/> abandoned because
                  the usual<br/> course at Hazelhatch was<br/> not
                  available.</p>
               <p>The Ormond 
                        M.C.C.
                        Motorcycle Club
                     , who<br/> organise to-day’s event, are a<br/> newly-formed
                  club and have<br/> never run any kind of<br/> open event before.</p>
            


            
               <h5>DOT TWINS</h5>
               <p>Some idea of the fare to<br/> be expected can be had from<br/> the performances in
                  last<br/> week’s Dunlop scramble.</p>
               <p>Chief interest is in the<br/>
                  250 c.c. class, where the<br/> newly
                  imported Dot twins in the hands of Jack
                     Kavenagh<br/> and Gerald Scarlett do
                  battle<br/> with the new 
                        A.M.C.
                        Associated Motorcycles
                      engined<br/>
                  Francis Barnetts, ridden by<br/>
                  Ian Williams and  Jim<br/>
                     Kavenagh.</p>
               <p>Ian Williams is Ariel-<br/> mounted in the 500 c.c. class.</p>
               <p>The competition comes<br/> from his brother, Eric, who<br/>
                  rides either an Ariel or a<br/>
                  JAP-engined special, and<br/>
                  George Harps, also Ariel-<br/> mounted.</p>
               <p>Dermot Byrne rides his<br/> recently acquired JAP.</p>
            


            
               <h5>LOCAL MEN</h5>
               <p>Local interest is in<br/>
                  Dalcassian
                        Dalcassian Motorcycle Club
                      riders McEoin<br/> (James), Kelly (James), Len-<br/> non
                     (Norton).</p>
               <p>Early entries close to-<br/> morrow for the Limerick<br/> Motor
                     Club’s
                  Circuit of<br/> Munster, the annual car<br/> rally held
                  over the Whit<br/> week-end.</p>
               <p>This year’s event takes the<br/> same form as that of pre-<br/> vious years—about
                  600 miles<br/> of driving in two days.</p>
               <p>here are four starting<br/> points — Cork,
                     Limerick,<br/>
                  Dublin, and Urlingford.</p>
            


            
            
               <h5>BIG ENTRY</h5>
               <p>THERE is a big entry for<br/> the Athlone
                  Hockey<br/> Club’s annual mixed 6-a-side<br/> tournament at Grace Park,<br/>

               <h2>Isle of Man Win<br/> For Miller?</h2>
            
            
               <p>THIS week sees the annual
                  mecca of motor-<br/> cyclists in full swing. The Isle of
                     Man<br/>
                  
                        TT
                        Tourist Trophy
                      week is just as attractive as ever and Irish-<br/> men are
                  likely to be as prominent as usual.</p>
            
            
            
               <p>We stand a good chance<br/> of seeing Sammy Miller<br/>
                  finish in front this year.<br/> He will be riding a 125 c.c<br/> Ducati in the ultra light-<br/>
                     weight event over Clypse<br/> on Wednesday.</p>
               <p>In the 250 c.c. event he<br/> rides a
                     Czechoslovakian CZ<br/> and his
                  competition will<br/> include two other Ulster<br/> riders who should not be
                  too<br/> far behind—Tommy Robb<br/> and Davy
                     Andrews, who<br/> ride N.S.U.s entered by<br/>
                  Tommy Hill.</p>
            

            
               <h5>FAVOURITE</h5>
               <p> Another Ulsterman rides<br/> in both senior and junior<br/> events on an A.J.S.
                  (350)<br/> and a Norton (500).</p>
               <p>Judging by practice times<br/> last week, it seems that John<br/>
                  must be a favourite for the senior honours of the<br/>
                  week on a works M.V.<br/> Augusta.</p>
               <p>Irish fans, returning from<br/> the Island immediately
                  after<br/> the 
                        I.O.M.
                        Isle of Man
                      racing, will<br/> move straight to
                     Butlin’s<br/> Holiday Camp, Mosney,<br/> where the Dublin and Dis-<br/> trict 
                        M.C.C.
                        Motorcycle Club
                     
                   hold their<br/> annual championship meet-<br/> ing next Saturday.</p>
            

            
               <h5>BIG SURPRISE</h5>
               <p>Included in the programme<br/> will be the National two-<br/>
                     mile 500 c.c. and 250 c.c.<br/> championships, as well as<br/> the 350 c.c. southern centre<br/> one.</p>
               <p> I expect Davy Dixon to<br/> retain this title, but if a<br/>
