               <h2>The Ian Williams Motocross Collection: A Digital Transcription</h2>

               <p>This website is home to the digitised version of a scrapbook created by the late Ian Williams (left),
                  detailing his time as a motocross competitor during the 1950s in Ireland.
               <p>

               <p> Ian, along with his brother, Eric, were well known in the Dublin motocross circles and featured in
                  numerous newspaper articles, a selection of which are presented here. Our aims for this project are to
                  preserve a piece of family history and to contribute to the sporting and cultural heritage of Ireland.
               </p>

               <p>The digitisation of this collection was carried out by Jacqueline Williams and Elisabeth Nonstad as
                  part of the Digitising Cultural Heritage Material course in the Library and Information Science,
                  Digital Library and Information Services Masters Programme at the University of Bor√•s, Sweden.</p>
