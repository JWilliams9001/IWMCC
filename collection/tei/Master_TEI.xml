               future in this country for such<lb/>
               an event<lb/>
               Irish riders’ lack of practice was<lb/>
               obvious and if they are to hold<lb/>
               their own in the future there must<lb/>
               be more events for training. It was<lb/>
               very interesting to see how quickly<lb/>
               some of them "caught on” last Satur-<lb/>
               day. The outstanding Irish competi-<lb/>
               tor was Ian Williams, who has had<lb/>
               some experience recently in Eng-<lb/>
               land, where he was riding for the<lb/>
               Ariel factory.<lb/>
               The most obvious things that<lb/>
               our men have to learn are. keep-<lb/>
               ing the taps open and front wheel<lb/>
               control. It was wonderful to see<lb/>
               how the British experts could con-<lb/>
               trol their bikes at higher speeds<lb/>
               than those at which many of our<lb/>
               men were losing control of their<lb/>
               machines.<lb/>
               Front wheel lifting seems to be<lb/>
               the answer. At one particularly<lb/>
               tricky point, the course crossed a<lb/>
               lane. Here the less experienced were<lb/>
               “ jumping ” their machines at the<lb/>
               start of the crossing, landing on the<lb/>
               far side of the lane and “ jumping ”<lb/>
               a second time<lb/>
               
               MUCH QUICKER
               <lb/>
               THE experts took it much faster,<lb/>
               cleared the lot with one jump<lb/>
               and landed on the back wheel,<lb/>
               keeping the front wheel off the<lb/>
               ground until they had things<lb/>
               perfectly under control.<lb/>
               Alex Woods was another of<lb/>
               Irish competitors who showed up<lb/>
               well earning fourth place in the<lb/>
               350 race and fifth, after Williams,<lb/>
               in the 500 race on his fast 350<lb/>
               machine. Ernie Lyons did well to<lb/>
               drive a “wedge” amongst the four<lb/>
               Dot works men in the 250 race but<lb/>
               it appeared to me that his N.S.U.<lb/>
               did not have the speed of the Dots,<lb/>
               and he appeared to tire, possibly <lb/>
               through having to work so hard<lb/>
               with a slower machine.<lb/>
               The surprise of the meeting was<lb/>
               the great improvement in the riding<lb/>
               of Eric Williams, brother of Ian.<lb/>
               His win in the handicap was well<lb/>
               merited.<lb/>
               Revenue Is a big difficulty for<lb/>
               clubs here as the big events are<lb/>
               road races where no admission<lb/>
               charge is possible, but I think that<lb/>
               more events of the Moto-Cross<lb/>
               variety, which are run on enclosed<lb/>
               circuits where a charge can be col-<lb/>
               lected, may at least be part of the!<lb/>
               answer.<lb/>
               
               
               BIG ATTENDANCE
               <lb/>
               THIS type of sport is a novelty to<lb/>
               Irish people, but there was<lb/>
               quite a big attendance on Satur-<lb/>
               day, and as word gets around as<lb/>
               to its value its appeal will<lb/>
               increase.<lb/>
               
               I know that the calendar is<lb/>
               already very full, but it might be<lb/>
               worth while dropping some other<lb/>
               events in favour of the Moto-Cross,<lb/>
               and now is the time to plan.<lb/>
               With the last of the racing season<lb/>
               events on Saturday, the 5OO<lb/>
               M.R.C.I. car meeting in Ulster, the<lb/>
               trials season opens in a big way<lb/>
               this month.<lb/>
               For bikes there are three champion-<lb/>
               ship trials in October, the Belfast and<lb/>
               District Club’s, Barr Trophy (6th),<lb/>
               the Dublin and District Club’s,<lb/>
               Moran Cup (13th), and the Ulster<lb/>
               President’s Cup (27th).<lb/>
               On Saturday in the Dublin area<lb/>
               there is the Dublin University Club’s,<lb/>
               Fall Trial, starting from Lamb<lb/>
               Doyles (3.0). For cars on Saturday<lb/>
               there is the Leinster Club’s, Vigzol<lb/>
               Cup Trial, a non-observed event,<lb/>
               starting from the Phoenix Monument<lb/>
               (3.0).<lb/>
               on Sunday there is the first of the<lb/>
               trials counting towards this season’s<lb/>
               Hewison Trophy competition, the<lb/>
               Limerick Club’s Circuit of Clare,<lb/>
               which this year takes the place in<lb/>
               the series of the same club’s Circuit<lb/>
               of Munster. The other Hewison event<lb/>
               this month is the Kilkenny Winter<lb/>
               Trial (28th).       <lb/>

               D. And D. Meeting<lb/>
               
               B.S.A.’s have just announced their<lb/>
               intention of sending over an<lb/>
               official works team for the Dublin<lb/>
               and District Motor Cycle Club’s<lb/>
               International Moto Cross meeting<lb/>
               over the new course at Red Bog<lb/>
               later in the month and this news<lb/>
               will certainly give a terrific boost<lb/>
               to the already highly interesting<lb/>
               programme.<lb/>
               The Birmingham factory will be<lb/>
               represented by the high ranking<lb/>
               English stars, Brian Stonebridge,<lb/>
               David Tye and Terry Cheshire all<lb/>
               of whom will be supplied with<lb/>
               Senior and Junior " Gold Stars.”<lb/>
               Cheshire and Tye were both seen<lb/>
               in action at the Curragh last year,<lb/>
               but Stonebridge, who is in the<lb/>
               world championship class will be<lb/>
               making his first appearance on our<lb/>
               soil.<lb/>
               Enquiries have also been received<lb/>
               from Dutch and German riders and<lb/>
               it is quite possible that a number<lb/>
               of them will make the trip to<lb/>
               Ireland immediately after the con-<lb/>
               clusion of the International Six<lb/>
               Days’ Trial on the Continent.<lb/>
               Well-known Ulster men already<lb/>
               included in the colourful line-up are<lb/>
               Alex McFarland-Woods, Brian Cross<lb/>
               and Alan Bradshaw while the cross-<lb/>
               Channel Dot team have asked for<lb/>
               special permission to compete in all<lb/>
               classes. Fortunately there is a<lb/>
               clause in the regulations which
               makes a proviso giving visitors a
               special concession in this respect so
               that Bill Barugh and his team
               mates will be able to face the
               starter as often as they wish. 
               And indeed, judging by some of
               their outstanding performances in
               the past, it is safe to say that
               these 197 c.c. two-strokers will be
               more than a match for many of
               their heavyweight rivals.
               One of the strongest Irish teams
               should be the Ariel trio, nominated
               by Mr. Ted Barrett, of Mountjoy
               Motor Cycles, Ltd. This very fast
               line-up consists of Des. Cullen and
               the Williams’ brothers, Ian and Eric,
               who have been riding with such dis-
               tinction during the past few seasons.
               The Phibsboro’ sponsor has always
               been very closely connected with the
               sport, and any successes gained by
               his B.S.A. or Ariel nominees have
               been very well received by followers
               of all branches of the game.
               Most of the leading Dublin expo-
               nents have already sent in their
               entries, but it should be noted that
               the list will finally close on Satur-
               day, and no late entries can possibly
               be considered after that date. In-
               deed. by the looks of things, it may
               well happen that some prospective
               competitors will have to be included
               amongst the reserves if nominations
               continue to pour in at the present.

            hat-trick
            
            DAVID LONG (Dodler) had a
            most successful day at the
            Irish M.C.C. grasstrack races at
            Bloomfield, Merrion road, Dublin,
            yesterday, winning the first race, a
            graded scratch event, and the last,
            the allcomers’ handicap, in which he
            passed the limit man, C. O'Connor
            (Francis-Barnett) at half-distance
            and went on to win by nine seconds.
            He nearly won the 250 c.c. scratch
            race also, but was brought off on
            the last lap by G. F. Scarlett (Dot),
            who was attempting to pass him.
            Fastest riders were the Williams
            brothers, lan beating Eric to win
            his graded scratch race in best time
            of the day, 2m. 38s., and Eric turn-
            ing the tables in the 500 c.c. scratch,
            which he won in the same time.

            Big Test
            Nenagh
            
            AT three o’clock this afternoon, the first 1958
            motor-cycle grass-track event will get
            under way at Drummin Field, just outside
            Nenagh town.
            This is the first time that
            such an honour has fallen
            to a provincial club.
            And it is due to the fact
            that the I.M.C.C. date
            scheduled for yesterday was
            abandoned because the usual
            course at Hazelhatch was
            not available.
            The Ormond M.C.C., who
            organise to-day’s event, are a
            newly-formed club and have
            never run any kind of
            open event before.
            
            DOT TWINS
            Some idea of the fare to
            be expected can be had from
            the performances in last
            week’s Dunlop scramble.
            Chief interest is in the
            250 c.c. class, where the
            newly imported Dot twins in
            the hands of Jack Kavenagh
            and Gerald Scarlett do battle
            with the new A.M.C. engined
            Francis Barnetts, ridden by
            Ian Williams and Jim
            Kavenagh.
            Ian Williams is Ariel-
            mounted in the 500 c.c.
            class.
            The competition comes
            from his brother, Eric, who
            rides either an Ariel or a
            JAP-engined special, and
            George Harps, also Ariel-
            mounted.
            Dermot Byrne rides his
            recently acquired JAP.
            
            LOCAL MEN
            Local interest is in
            Dalcassian riders McEoin
            (James), Kelly (James), Len-
            non (Norton).
            Early entries close to-
            morrow for the Limerick
            Motor Club’s Circuit of
            Munster, the annual car
            rally held over the Whit
            week-end.
            This year’s event takes the
            same form as that of pre-
            vious years—about 600 miles
            of driving in two days.
            There are four starting
            points — Cork, Limerick,
            Dublin, and Urlingford.
            
            BIG ENTRY
            THERE is a big entry for
            the Athlone Hockey

            cyclists in full swing. The Isle of Man
            TT week is just as attractive as ever and Irish-
            men are likely to be as prominent as usual.
            We stand a good chance
            of seeing Sammy Miller
            finish in front this year.
            He will be riding a 125 c.c
            Ducati in the ultra light-
            weight event over Clypse
            on Wednesday.
            In the 250 c.c. event he
            rides a Czechoslovakian CZ
            and his competition will
            include two other Ulster
            riders who should not be too
            far behind—Tommy Robb
            and Davy Andrews, who
            ride N.S.U.s entered by
            Tommy Hill.
            
            FAVOURITE
            Another Ulsterman rides
            in both senior and junior
            events on an A.J.S. (350)
            and a Norton (500).
            Judging by practice times
            last week, it seems that John
            (Illegible) must be a favourite
            for the senior honours of the
            week on a works M.V.
            Augusta.
            Irish fans, returning from
            the Island immediately after
            the I.O.M. racing, will
            move straight to Butlin’s
            Holiday Camp, Mosney,
            where the Dublin and Dis-
            trict M.C.C. hold their
            annual championship meet-
            ing next Saturday.
            
            BIG SURPRISE
            Included in the programme
            will be the National two-
            mile 500 c.c. and 250 c.c.
            championships, as well as
            the 350 c.c. southern centre
            one.
            I expect Davy Dixon to
            retain this title, but if a
            southerner comes out on top
            in either of the others it will
            be a big surprise.
            
            SAMMY MILLER
            Ian Williams, on the
            Francis Barnett, might just
            manage it in the 250 race.
            Racing starts at 3.30 and
            will conclude at about 
            5.45 p.m.
