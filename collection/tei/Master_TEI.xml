            <p>CHAMPIONSHIP CHALLENGER . . . Dublin rider Ian Williams
               (Ariel) who rides in to-morrow’s Hurst Cup International Trial
               at Conling, Belfast.
               
               Hurst Cup Trial Has
               Big English Entry
               
               By BASIL BRINDLEY
               
               WITH an entry of 79 for to-morrow’s Hurst Cup Trial,
               officials of the Knock Motor Cycle Club must be
               feeling very happy, as 80 is the maximum figure
               specified on the regulations.
               The international event 
               will be held over a number of
               laps in the Clandeboye
               Estate, Belfast, and total
               distance will be somewhat
               less than 50 miles.
               English competitors did excep-
               tionally well last year and,
               judging by the increase in their
               numbers on this occasion, they
               intend to return with the valuable
               perpetual trophy for another 12
               months.
               The Sunbeam Motor Cycle Club
               is responsible for no less than
               seven members of the eighteen-
               strong cross - Channel challenge.
               Included in this team are Johnny
               Brittain (Royal Enfield), P. H.
               Alves (Triumph), B. W. Martin
               (B.S.A.) and the Wicken brothers
               who will be Norman and Triumph-
               mounted.
               Scotsman J. H. Birrell has entered
               a junior " Gold Star" while other
               visitors of note are E. Usher (Match-
               less), G. L. Jackson (A.J.S.), E. W.
               Smith (Francis Barnett) and J. V.
               Smith (B.S.A.)
               | Leinster will be represented by
               practically every outstanding rider in
               the province and regulars like Dudley
               Ryder (Matchless), Joe Dawson
               (B.S.A.), Mick Tracey (Norton),
               Freddie Dickson (Sun) and Kevin
               Keegan (B.S.A.) may be relied upon
               to acquit themselves well.
               Strong Ulster Bid
               Travelling up from the south also
               with good reputations are Dave
               Felton (Francis Barnett), Ian
               Williams, Reg Armstrong (Gilera)
               and James exponents Ernie Lyons,
               Doug Ewen and Aubrey Archer.
               With over 50 p.c. Of the entry,
               Ulster is in a strong position and
               if a Six-County man is to win the
               event, it’s odds on Sammy Miller
               from Belfast being the one to do
               it. Riding a 197 c.c, James, this
               road racing and trials star has
               proved himself almost invincible
               during the season and he must
               have an outstanding chance to-
               morrow.
               Able support will come from Bill
               Clark (Royal Enfield). Tommy Robb
               (Francis Barnett), W. J. Hutton
               (Greeves), Terry Hill (B.S.A.), Brian
               McClery (Royal Enfield) and Bertie
               Mann (Francis Barnett), all of whom
               have been figuring well in this year’s
               events.
               The trial begins at 12 o’clock and
               starting point is near the Lead Mines,
               Conling.

            <p>12 Irish Independent, Wednesday, October 3, 1956
               Motor Sport Review
               
               Moto-Cross Was
               Great Success
               
               BY BARRY MASON
               
               THE outstanding success of the
               Dublin and District Motor Cycle
               Club's Moto-Cross last Saturday
               indicated that there is a bright
               future in this country for such
               an event
               Irish riders’ lack of practice was
               obvious and if they are to hold
               their own in the future there must
               be more events for training. It was
               very interesting to see how quickly
               some of them "caught on” last Satur-
               day. The outstanding Irish competi-
               tor was Ian Williams, who has had
               some experience recently in Eng-
               land, where he was riding for the
               Ariel factory.
               The most obvious things that
               our men have to learn are. keep-
               ing the taps open and front wheel
               control. It was wonderful to see
               how the British experts could con-
               trol their bikes at higher speeds
               than those at which many of our
               men were losing control of their
               machines.
               Front wheel lifting seems to be
               the answer. At one particularly
               tricky point, the course crossed a
               lane. Here the less experienced were
               “ jumping ” their machines at the
               start of the crossing, landing on the
               far side of the lane and “ jumping ”
               a second time
               
               MUCH QUICKER
               
               THE experts took it much faster,
               cleared the lot with one jump
               and landed on the back wheel,
               keeping the front wheel off the
               ground until they had things
               perfectly under control.
               Alex Woods was another of
               Irish competitors who showed up
               well earning fourth place in the
               350 race and fifth, after Williams,
               in the 500 race on his fast 350
               machine. Ernie Lyons did well to
               drive a “wedge” amongst the four
               Dot works men in the 250 race but
               it appeared to me that his N.S.U.
               did not have the speed of the Dots,
               and he appeared to tire, possibly 
               through having to work so hard
               with a slower machine.
               The surprise of the meeting was
               the great improvement in the riding
               of Eric Williams, brother of Ian.
               His win in the handicap was well
               merited.
               Revenue Is a big difficulty for
               clubs here as the big events are
               road races where no admission
               charge is possible, but I think that
               more events of the Moto-Cross
               variety, which are run on enclosed
               circuits where a charge can be col-
               lected, may at least be part of the!
               answer.
               
               
               BIG ATTENDANCE
               
               THIS type of sport is a novelty to
               Irish people, but there was
               quite a big attendance on Satur-
               day, and as word gets around as
               to its value its appeal will
               increase.
               
               I know that the calendar is
               already very full, but it might be
               worth while dropping some other
               events in favour of the Moto-Cross,
               and now is the time to plan.
               With the last of the racing season
               events on Saturday, the 5OO
               M.R.C.I. car meeting in Ulster, the
               trials season opens in a big way
               this month.
               For bikes there are three champion-
               ship trials in October, the Belfast and
               District Club’s, Barr Trophy (6th),
               the Dublin and District Club’s,
               Moran Cup (13th), and the Ulster
               President’s Cup (27th).
               On Saturday in the Dublin area
               there is the Dublin University Club’s,
               Fall Trial, starting from Lamb
               Doyles (3.0). For cars on Saturday
               there is the Leinster Club’s, Vigzol
               Cup Trial, a non-observed event,
               starting from the Phoenix Monument
               (3.0).
               on Sunday there is the first of the
               trials counting towards this season’s
               Hewison Trophy competition, the
               Limerick Club’s Circuit of Clare,
               which this year takes the place in
               the series of the same club’s Circuit
               of Munster. The other Hewison event
               this month is the Kilkenny Winter
               Trial (28th).

               B.S.A. Works Team For
               D. And D. Meeting
               
               B.S.A.’s have just announced their
               intention of sending over an
               official works team for the Dublin
               and District Motor Cycle Club’s
               International Moto Cross meeting
               over the new course at Red Bog
               later in the month and this news
               will certainly give a terrific boost
               to the already highly interesting
               programme.
               The Birmingham factory will be
               represented by the high ranking
               English stars, Brian Stonebridge,
               David Tye and Terry Cheshire all
               of whom will be supplied with
               Senior and Junior " Gold Stars.”
               Cheshire and Tye were both seen
               in action at the Curragh last year,
               but Stonebridge, who is in the
               world championship class will be
               making his first appearance on our
               soil.
               Enquiries have also been received
               from Dutch and German riders and
               it is quite possible that a number
               of them will make the trip to
               Ireland immediately after the con-
               clusion of the International Six
               Days’ Trial on the Continent.
               Well-known Ulster men already
               included in the colourful line-up are
               Alex McFarland-Woods, Brian Cross
               and Alan Bradshaw while the cross-
               Channel Dot team have asked for
               special permission to compete in all
               classes. Fortunately there is a
               clause in the regulations which
               makes a proviso giving visitors a
               special concession in this respect so
               that Bill Barugh and his team
               mates will be able to face the
               starter as often as they wish. 
               And indeed, judging by some of
               their outstanding performances in
               the past, it is safe to say that
               these 197 c.c. two-strokers will be
               more than a match for many of
               their heavyweight rivals.
               One of the strongest Irish teams
               should be the Ariel trio, nominated
               by Mr. Ted Barrett, of Mountjoy
               Motor Cycles, Ltd. This very fast
               line-up consists of Des. Cullen and
               the Williams’ brothers, Ian and Eric,
               who have been riding with such dis-
               tinction during the past few seasons.
               The Phibsboro’ sponsor has always
               been very closely connected with the
               sport, and any successes gained by
               his B.S.A. or Ariel nominees have
               been very well received by followers
               of all branches of the game.
               Most of the leading Dublin expo-
               nents have already sent in their
               entries, but it should be noted that
               the list will finally close on Satur-
               day, and no late entries can possibly
               be considered after that date. In-
               deed. by the looks of things, it may
               well happen that some prospective
               competitors will have to be included
               amongst the reserves if nominations
               continue to pour in at the present.

            hat-trick
            
            DAVID LONG (Dodler) had a
            most successful day at the
            Irish M.C.C. grasstrack races at
            Bloomfield, Merrion road, Dublin,
            yesterday, winning the first race, a
            graded scratch event, and the last,
            the allcomers’ handicap, in which he
            passed the limit man, C. O'Connor
            (Francis-Barnett) at half-distance
            and went on to win by nine seconds.
            He nearly won the 250 c.c. scratch
            race also, but was brought off on
            the last lap by G. F. Scarlett (Dot),
            who was attempting to pass him.
            Fastest riders were the Williams
            brothers, lan beating Eric to win
            his graded scratch race in best time
            of the day, 2m. 38s., and Eric turn-
            ing the tables in the 500 c.c. scratch,
            which he won in the same time.

            Big Test
            Nenagh
            
            AT three o’clock this afternoon, the first 1958
            motor-cycle grass-track event will get
            under way at Drummin Field, just outside
            Nenagh town.
            This is the first time that
            such an honour has fallen
            to a provincial club.
            And it is due to the fact
            that the I.M.C.C. date
            scheduled for yesterday was
            abandoned because the usual
            course at Hazelhatch was
            not available.
            The Ormond M.C.C., who
            organise to-day’s event, are a
            newly-formed club and have
            never run any kind of
            open event before.
            
            DOT TWINS
            Some idea of the fare to
            be expected can be had from
            the performances in last
            week’s Dunlop scramble.
            Chief interest is in the
            250 c.c. class, where the
            newly imported Dot twins in
            the hands of Jack Kavenagh
            and Gerald Scarlett do battle
            with the new A.M.C. engined
            Francis Barnetts, ridden by
            Ian Williams and Jim
            Kavenagh.
            Ian Williams is Ariel-
            mounted in the 500 c.c.
            class.
            The competition comes
            from his brother, Eric, who
            rides either an Ariel or a
            JAP-engined special, and
            George Harps, also Ariel-
            mounted.
            Dermot Byrne rides his
            recently acquired JAP.
            
            LOCAL MEN
            Local interest is in
            Dalcassian riders McEoin
            (James), Kelly (James), Len-
            non (Norton).
            Early entries close to-
            morrow for the Limerick
            Motor Club’s Circuit of
            Munster, the annual car
            rally held over the Whit
            week-end.
            This year’s event takes the
            same form as that of pre-
            vious years—about 600 miles
            of driving in two days.
            There are four starting
            points — Cork, Limerick,
            Dublin, and Urlingford.
            
            BIG ENTRY
            THERE is a big entry for
            the Athlone Hockey
            Club’s annual mixed 6-a-side
            tournament at Grace Park,
            Athlone, to-day.</p></div>

            <div type="article" n="10.3"><p>Isle of Man Win
            For Miller?
            
            THIS week sees the annual mecca of motor-
            cyclists in full swing. The Isle of Man
            TT week is just as attractive as ever and Irish-
            men are likely to be as prominent as usual.
            We stand a good chance
            of seeing Sammy Miller
            finish in front this year.
            He will be riding a 125 c.c
            Ducati in the ultra light-
            weight event over Clypse
            on Wednesday.
            In the 250 c.c. event he
            rides a Czechoslovakian CZ
            and his competition will
            include two other Ulster
            riders who should not be too
            far behind—Tommy Robb
            and Davy Andrews, who
            ride N.S.U.s entered by
            Tommy Hill.
            
            FAVOURITE
            Another Ulsterman rides
            in both senior and junior
            events on an A.J.S. (350)
            and a Norton (500).
            Judging by practice times
            last week, it seems that John
            (Illegible) must be a favourite
            for the senior honours of the
            week on a works M.V.
            Augusta.
            Irish fans, returning from
            the Island immediately after
            the I.O.M. racing, will
            move straight to Butlin’s
            Holiday Camp, Mosney,
            where the Dublin and Dis-
            trict M.C.C. hold their
            annual championship meet-
            ing next Saturday.
            
            BIG SURPRISE
            Included in the programme
            will be the National two-
            mile 500 c.c. and 250 c.c.
            championships, as well as
            the 350 c.c. southern centre
            one.
            I expect Davy Dixon to
            retain this title, but if a
            southerner comes out on top
            in either of the others it will
            be a big surprise.
            
            SAMMY MILLER
            Ian Williams, on the
            Francis Barnett, might just
            manage it in the 250 race.
            Racing starts at 3.30 and
            will conclude at about 
            5.45 p.m.
