            <p>CHAMPIONSHIP CHALLENGER . . . Dublin rider Ian Williams
               (Ariel) who rides in to-morrow’s Hurst Cup International Trial
               at Conling, Belfast.
               
               Hurst Cup Trial Has
               Big English Entry
               
               By BASIL BRINDLEY
               
               WITH an entry of 79 for to-morrow’s Hurst Cup Trial,
               officials of the Knock Motor Cycle Club must be
               feeling very happy, as 80 is the maximum figure
               specified on the regulations.
               The international event 
               will be held over a number of
               laps in the Clandeboye
               Estate, Belfast, and total
               distance will be somewhat
               less than 50 miles.
               English competitors did excep-
               tionally well last year and,
               judging by the increase in their
               numbers on this occasion, they
               intend to return with the valuable
               perpetual trophy for another 12
               months.
               The Sunbeam Motor Cycle Club
               is responsible for no less than
               seven members of the eighteen-
               strong cross - Channel challenge.
               Included in this team are Johnny
               Brittain (Royal Enfield), P. H.
               Alves (Triumph), B. W. Martin
               (B.S.A.) and the Wicken brothers
               who will be Norman and Triumph-
               mounted.
               Scotsman J. H. Birrell has entered
               a junior " Gold Star" while other
               visitors of note are E. Usher (Match-
               less), G. L. Jackson (A.J.S.), E. W.
               Smith (Francis Barnett) and J. V.
               Smith (B.S.A.)
               | Leinster will be represented by
               practically every outstanding rider in
               the province and regulars like Dudley
               Ryder (Matchless), Joe Dawson
               (B.S.A.), Mick Tracey (Norton),
               Freddie Dickson (Sun) and Kevin
               Keegan (B.S.A.) may be relied upon
               to acquit themselves well.
               Strong Ulster Bid
               Travelling up from the south also
               with good reputations are Dave
               Felton (Francis Barnett), Ian
               Williams, Reg Armstrong (Gilera)
               and James exponents Ernie Lyons,
               Doug Ewen and Aubrey Archer.
               With over 50 p.c. Of the entry,
               Ulster is in a strong position and
               if a Six-County man is to win the
               event, it’s odds on Sammy Miller
               from Belfast being the one to do
               it. Riding a 197 c.c, James, this
               road racing and trials star has
               proved himself almost invincible
               during the season and he must
               have an outstanding chance to-
               morrow.
               Able support will come from Bill
               Clark (Royal Enfield). Tommy Robb
               (Francis Barnett), W. J. Hutton
               (Greeves), Terry Hill (B.S.A.), Brian
               McClery (Royal Enfield) and Bertie
               Mann (Francis Barnett), all of whom
               have been figuring well in this year’s
               events.
               The trial begins at 12 o’clock and
               starting point is near the Lead Mines,
               Conling.
